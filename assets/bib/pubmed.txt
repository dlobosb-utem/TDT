TI  - Bioinformatic Analyses of Unique (Orphan) Core Genes of the Genus 
      Acidithiobacillus: Functional Inferences and Use As Molecular Probes for Genomic 
      and Metagenomic/Transcriptomic Interrogation.

AB  - Using phylogenomic and gene compositional analyses, five highly conserved gene 
      families have been detected in the core genome of the phylogenetically coherent 
      genus Acidithiobacillus of the class Acidithiobacillia. These core gene families 
      are absent in the closest extant genus Thermithiobacillus tepidarius that 
      subtends the Acidithiobacillus genus and roots the deepest in this class. The 
      predicted proteins encoded by these core gene families are not detected by a 
      BLAST search in the NCBI non-redundant database of more than 90 million proteins 
      using a relaxed cut-off of 1.0e(-5). None of the five families has a clear 
      functional prediction. However, bioinformatic scrutiny, using pI prediction, 
      motif/domain searches, cellular location predictions, genomic context analyses, 
      and chromosome topology studies together with previously published transcriptomic 
      and proteomic data, suggests that some may have functions associated with 
      membrane remodeling during cell division perhaps in response to pH stress. 
      Despite the high level of amino acid sequence conservation within each family, 
      there is sufficient nucleotide variation of the respective genes to permit the 
      use of the DNA sequences to distinguish different species of Acidithiobacillus, 
      making them useful additions to the armamentarium of tools for phylogenetic 
      analysis. Since the protein families are unique to the Acidithiobacillus genus, 
      they can also be leveraged as probes to detect the genus in environmental 
      metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, including industrial biomining operations, 
      and acid mine drainage (AMD).

TI  - Dysregulated gastric microbial communities and functional shifts in chronic 
      atrophic versus non-atrophic gastritis: a Helicobacter pylori-Negative 
      observational study.
PG  - 304
LID - 10.1186/s12876-025-03900-4 [doi]
LID - 304
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was identified as a 
      substantial risk factor for gastric cancer development, but the eradication of H. 
      pylori did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the incidence of gastric 
      cancer. Non-Helicobacter pylori (non-H. pylori) bacteria in the stomach are 
      involved in the transformation of gastritis carcinoma. The aim of this study was 
      to characterize the microbiome composition of the gastric mucosa and its 
      functions in non-H. pylori (H. pylori-negative) patients with chronic atrophic 
      gastritis (CAG) and chronic non-atrophic gastritis (CNAG). METHODS: Fourteen CNAG 
      samples and twenty-three CAG samples were collected. The composition of the 
      gastric microbiome was analyzed using 16 S rDNA gene sequencing. The 
      bioinformatic analysis was performed using alpha and beta diversity analyses, 
      PICRUSt2, and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe). RESULTS: The two 
      groups shared the same most abundant bacterial phyla (Pseudomonadota, Bacillota, 
      Actinomycetota, and Bacteroidota). The top 5 most abundant bacterial genera in 
      the CAG group were Sphingomonas, Ralstonia, Brevundimonas, Methyloversatilis, and 
      Pseudomonas. In the CNAG group, the top genera were Brevundimonas, Ralstonia, 
      Sphingomonas, Methyloversatilis, and Acinetobacter. Differential analysis 
      revealed distinct genera between groups: the CAG group showed enrichment in 
      Sphingomonas, Ralstonia, Bradyrhizobium, Roseateles, and Acidithiobacillus, while 
      the CNAG group was enriched in Brevundimonas, Rhodococcus, Hydrogenophaga, 
      Bacteroides, and Leifsonia (p < 0.05). Sphingomonas exhibited a positive 
      correlation with Acidithiobacillus but negative correlations with Brevundimonas, 
      Hydrogenophaga, and Leifsonia. Pathways related to xenobiotic biodegradation, 
      metabolism, signal transduction, cofactor/vitamin metabolism, cancer, infectious 
      diseases, and digestive system were enriched in the CAG group. In contrast, the 
      CNAG group showed enrichment in amino acid metabolism, translation, 
      replication/repair, and terpenoid/polyketide metabolism. CONCLUSION: Gastric 
      mucosal microbiota dysbiosis and functional shifts are significantly associated 
      with chronic atrophic gastritis. Taxa such as Sphingomonas and Ralstonia, 
      enriched in CAG patients, may indicate microbial signatures associated with early 
      atrophic transition and provide candidates for further mechanistic validation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome sequencing has revolutionized our view of the relationships 
      among genomes, particularly in revealing the confounding effects of lateral 
      genetic transfer (LGT). Phylogenomic techniques have been used to construct 
      purported trees of microbial life. Although such trees are easily interpreted and 
      allow the use of a subset of genomes as "proxies" for the full set, LGT and other 
      phenomena impact the positioning of different groups in genome trees, confounding 
      and potentially invalidating attempts to construct a phylogeny-based taxonomy of 
      microorganisms. Network and graph approaches can reveal complex sets of 
      relationships, but applying these techniques to large data sets is a significant 
      challenge. Notwithstanding the question of what exactly it might represent, 
      generating and interpreting a Tree or Network of All Genomes will only be 
      feasible if current algorithms can be improved upon. RESULTS: Complex 
      relationships among even the most-similar genomes demonstrate that proxy-based 
      approaches to simplifying large sets of genomes are not alone sufficient to solve 
      the analysis problem. A phylogenomic analysis of 1173 sequenced bacterial and 
      archaeal genomes generated phylogenetic trees for 159,905 distinct homologous 
      gene sets. The relationships inferred from this set can be heavily dependent on 
      the inclusion of other taxa: for example, phyla such as Spirochaetes, 
      Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are recovered as cohesive groups or split depending 
      on the presence of other specific lineages. Furthermore, named groups such as 
      Acidithiobacillus, Coprothermobacter and Brachyspira show a multitude of 
      affiliations that are more consistent with their ecology than with small subunit 
      ribosomal DNA-based taxonomy. Network and graph representations can illustrate 
      the multitude of conflicting affinities, but all methods impose constraints on 
      the input data and create challenges of construction and interpretation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These complex relationships highlight the need for an inclusive 
      approach to genomic data, and current methods with minor alterations will likely 
      scale to allow the analysis of data sets with 10,000 or more genomes. The main 
      challenges lie in the visualization and interpretation of genomic relationships, 
      and the redefinition of microbial taxonomy when subsets of genomic data are so 
      evidently in conflict with one another, and with the "canonical" molecular 
      taxonomy.

AB  - A taxonomic and annotated functional description of microbial life was deduced 
      from 53 Mb of metagenomic sequence retrieved from a planktonic fraction of the 
      Neotropical high Andean (3,973 meters above sea level) acidic hot spring El 
      Coquito (EC). A classification of unassembled metagenomic reads using different 
      databases showed a high proportion of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria 
      (in total read affiliation), and through taxonomic affiliation of 16S rRNA gene 
      fragments we observed the presence of Proteobacteria, micro-algae chloroplast and 
      Firmicutes. Reads mapped against the genomes Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5, 
      Legionella pneumophila str. Corby and Acidithiobacillus caldus revealed the 
      presence of transposase-like sequences, potentially involved in horizontal gene 
      transfer. Functional annotation and hierarchical comparison with different 
      datasets obtained by pyrosequencing in different ecosystems showed that the 
      microbial community also contained extensive DNA repair systems, possibly to cope 
      with ultraviolet radiation at such high altitudes. Analysis of genes involved in 
      the nitrogen cycle indicated the presence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to 
      N2 (narGHI, nirS, norBCDQ and nosZ), associated with Proteobacteria-like 
      sequences. Genes involved in the sulfur cycle (cysDN, cysNC and aprA) indicated 
      adenylsulfate and sulfite production that were affiliated to several bacterial 
      species. In summary, metagenomic sequence data provided insight regarding the 
      structure and possible functions of this hot spring microbial community, 
      describing some groups potentially involved in the nitrogen and sulfur cycling in 
      this environment.

AB  - The names and lineages of microorganisms are critical to our understanding of the 
      microbiome. However, microbial taxonomy and phylogeny are in perpetual flux, with 
      emerging criteria being used to rename and reshape our views of the microbial 
      world. Different candidate molecular and nonmolecular criteria are often broadly 
      consistent with one another, which underpins the pluralistic approach to 
      taxonomy. However, the taxonomic picture is clouded when underlying criteria are 
      not in agreement, or when reference datasets contain erroneously named organisms. 
      How does the shifting taxonomic landscape impact our interpretation of microbial 
      communities, especially in the face of inconsistencies and errors? How can 
      taxonomy be applied in a consistent way when different users have different 
      requirements of the classifications that emerge? The key path forward involves 
      finding ways to integrate conflicting taxonomic criteria, choosing the right 
      units of analysis for microbiomic studies, and making molecular taxonomy 
      transparent and accessible in a way that complements current genomic resources.

LID - 10.1128/JVI.02261-12 [doi]
AB  - Development of reproducible genetic tools in the industrially important 
      acidithiobacilli is urgently required. Inducible temperate phages which may be 
      modified in vitro, propagated in suitable hosts, and used to transduce relevant 
      genetic information to other strains and/or species are potentially valuable 
      tools in this field of research. In order to address these current limitations, 
      the genome sequence of an inducible temperate Myoviridae-like bacteriophage from 
      the Acidithiobacillus caldus type strain was annotated and analyzed 
      bioinformatically. Here, we announce the genome sequence of AcaML1 and report 
      major findings from its annotation.

TI  - In silico genome analysis of an acid mine drainage species, Acidiphilium 
      multivorum, for potential commercial acetic acid production and biomining.
PG  - 447-454
LID - 10.1080/03601234.2019.1710985 [doi]
AB  - The genome of Acidiphilium multivorum strain AIU 301, acidophilic, aerobic 
      Gram-negative bacteria, was investigated for potential metabolic pathways 
      associated with organic acid production and metal uptake. The genome was compared 
      to other acidic mine drainage isolates, Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5 and 
      Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270, as well as Acetobacter pasteurianus 
      386B, which ferments cocoa beans. Plasmids between two Acidiphilium spp. were 
      compared, and only two of the sixteen plasmids were identified as potentially 
      similar. Comparisons of the genome size to the number of protein coding sequences 
      indicated that A. multivorum and A. cryptum follow the line of best fit unlike A. 
      pasteurianus 386B, which suggests that it was improperly annotated in the 
      database. Pathways between these four species were analyzed bioinformatically and 
      are discussed here. A. multivorum AIU 301, shares pathways with A. pasteurianus 
      386B including aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase pathways, which are used in the 
      generation of vinegar. Mercury reductase, arsenate reductase and sulfur 
      utilization proteins were identified and discussed at length. The absence of 
      sulfur utilization proteins from A. multivorum AIU 301 suggests that this species 
      uses previously undefined pathways for sulfur acquisition. Bioinformatic 
      examination revealed novel pathways that may benefit commercial fields including 
      acetic acid production and biomining.

TI  - Periplasmic proteins of the extremophile Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans: a high 
      throughput proteomics analysis.
PG  - 2239-51
AB  - Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a chemolithoautotrophic acidophile capable of 
      obtaining energy by oxidizing ferrous iron or sulfur compounds such as metal 
      sulfides. Some of the proteins involved in these oxidations have been described 
      as forming part of the periplasm of this extremophile. The detailed study of the 
      periplasmic components constitutes an important area to understand the physiology 
      and environmental interactions of microorganisms. Proteomics analysis of the 
      periplasmic fraction of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 was performed by using high 
      resolution linear ion trap-FT MS. We identified a total of 131 proteins in the 
      periplasm of the microorganism grown in thiosulfate. When possible, functional 
      categories were assigned to the proteins: 13.8% were transport and binding 
      proteins, 14.6% were several kinds of cell envelope proteins, 10.8% were involved 
      in energy metabolism, 10% were related to protein fate and folding, 10% were 
      proteins with unknown functions, and 26.1% were proteins without homologues in 
      databases. These last proteins are most likely characteristic of A. ferrooxidans 
      and may have important roles yet to be assigned. The majority of the periplasmic 
      proteins from A. ferrooxidans were very basic compared with those of neutrophilic 
      microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, suggesting a special adaptation of the 
      chemolithoautotrophic bacterium to its very acidic environment. The high 
      throughput proteomics approach used here not only helps to understand the 
      physiology of this extreme acidophile but also offers an important contribution 
      to the functional annotation for the available genomes of biomining 
      microorganisms such as A. ferrooxidans for which no efficient genetic systems are 
      available to disrupt genes by procedures such as homologous recombination.

TI  - Differential gene expression in response to copper in Acidithiobacillus 
      ferrooxidans strains possessing dissimilar copper resistance.
PG  - 491-8
AB  - Locus afe_0454 from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (At.ferrooxidans) is annotated 
      as related to copper resistance in The Institute for Genomic Research database. 
      In our study, two At.ferrooxidans strains, 26(#) and DC, with different levels of 
      copper ion resistance were isolated from acid mine drainages at two major copper 
      mines in China, and their copper-resistance capacity was determined. The 26(#) 
      strain had a copper-tolerance level of 0.22 mol/L, whereas the DC strain had a 
      lower copper-tolerance level of 0.04 mol/L. The mutant 26(#) was generated from 
      strain 26(#), and its copper-tolerance level was 0.25 mol/L. Using real-time 
      quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, differential 
      expression of the afe_0454 gene during copper ion stress of these three strains 
      was investigated. The results showed that the expression of afe_0454 was 
      increased under copper ion stress, indicating that the afe_0454 gene is sensitive 
      to copper levels. Furthermore, the afe_0454 gene expression ratio varied in the 
      different copper-resistant strains. Gene expression was highest in the highest 
      copper-resistant strain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the afe_0454 gene was 
      56.87% non-polar, indicating the AFE_0454 protein was hydrophobic. Searching with 
      the AFE_0454 protein in The Institute for Genomic Research database showed that 
      the structure of the copper resistance protein D (CopD), which transports copper 
      ions outside of the cell, had the highest sequence identity (46%). Bioinformatics 
      analysis showed that the AFE_0454 protein has eight transmembrane helixes and was 
      predicted to be localized to the plasma membrane. These results strongly 
      suggested that the AFE_0454 protein is likely a transmembrane protein and might 
      be directly involved in copper ion resistance.
