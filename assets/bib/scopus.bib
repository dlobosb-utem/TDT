	abstract = {Petroleum degradation by psychrophiles can be enhanced on the basis of omics analyses, which offer better sensitivity than traditional biochemical methods do. A metagenomic analysis focusing on gene abundance comparisons may provide new guidance to optimize soil decontamination under cold environmental conditions. The soil used in this study was sampled from Dalian, from which an indigenous consortium was isolated. The degradative soil systems, initially categorized into control (DLC) and experimental (DLD) groups, were kept at room temperature (20 ± 5 °C) for six weeks. The DLD group was subsequently transferred to a low-temperature environment (5–10 °C) for 90 days and renamed DDL. A petroleum removal rate of 74.59 % was achieved in the process from DLD to DDL groups. Each soil sample was subjected to analysis and metagenomic sequencing. The abundance of genes of interest was compared between pathways to determine trends. The findings demonstrate that psychrophilic degradation is more effective than natural remediation is. The soil microbial community structure displayed site specificity, with 802 genes in DDL associated with 249 pathways, indicating greater abundance of psychrophilic genes in DDL than in DLC. The abundance of key genes was at different orders of magnitude but showed similar trends. The abundance of genes associated with hydrocarbon-related metabolism surpassed that of genes associated with sphingolipid, fatty acid, or benzene metabolism. This study provides valuable insights into psychrophilic microbe-driven petroleum degradation and indicates the need for precise supplementation of biosurfactants to improve remediation efficiency. © 2025},

	abstract = {In contrast to acid mine drainage, the microbial assembly and (bio)geochemical processes in alkaline mine conditions remain under-investigated. Here, microbe-water-mineral interactions were systematically investigated in two representative iron mines with alkaline conditions in the Panxi mining area, Southwest China. Compared to reference riverine samples less interfered by mining activities, the iron ore samples, composed of vanadium-titanium magnetite and pyroxene-rich bedrocks, exhibited elevated levels of Fe, HCl-extractable Fe(II), total sulfur, nitrate and sulfate, but lower total carbon (TC). Meanwhile, the mine drainage showed significantly higher sulfate, but lower TC concentrations than the riverine samples. Intriguingly, the Serpentinimonas spp., typically reported in serpentinites, prevailed in the microbial communities from the mine samples exhibiting higher pH. This suggests that the alkaline environments in Panxi mines result from serpentinization-like reactions. Enrichment of Thiobacillus spp. was observed in the mine-dwelling microbial communities, positively correlated with total sulfur, sulfate, nitrate, and Fe(II). Genome-resolved metagenomics suggested a chemoautotrophic lifestyle for the Thiobacillus species (e.g., carbon fixation, sulfur oxidation, and oxygen respiration), which may generate H+ and mitigate alkalization. This study provides valuable insights into progressive development of alkaline mine ecosystems and offers guidance for developing appropriate engineering strategies to restore the abandoned alkaline mines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) have developed distinct ecological strategies to obtain reduced sulfur compounds for growth. These range from specialists that can only use a limited range of reduced sulfur compounds to generalists that can use many different forms as electron donors. Forming intimate symbioses with animal hosts is another highly successful ecological strategy for SOB, as animals, through their behavior and physiology, can enable access to sulfur compounds. Symbioses have evolved multiple times in a range of animal hosts and from several lineages of SOB. They have successfully colonized a wide range of habitats, from seagrass beds to hydrothermal vents, with varying availability of symbiont energy sources. Our extensive analyses of sulfur transformation pathways in 234 genomes of symbiotic and free-living SOB revealed widespread conservation in metabolic pathways for sulfur oxidation in symbionts from different host species and environments, raising the question of how they have adapted to such a wide range of distinct habitats. We discovered a gene family expansion of soxY in these genomes, with up to five distinct copies per genome. Symbionts harboring only the “canonical” soxY were typically ecological “specialists” that are associated with specific host subfamilies or environments (e.g., hydrothermal vents, mangroves). Conversely, symbionts with multiple divergent soxY genes formed versatile associations across diverse hosts in various marine environments. We hypothesize that expansion and diversification of the soxY gene family could be one genomic mechanism supporting the metabolic flexibility of symbiotic SOB enabling them and their hosts to thrive in a range of different and dynamic environments.

	abstract = {Himalayan glaciers are receding at an exceptional rate, perturbing the local biome and ecosystem processes. Understanding the microbial ecology of an exclusively microbe-driven biome provides insights into their contributions to the ecosystem functioning through biogeochemical fluxes. Here, we investigated the bacterial communities and their functional potential in the retreating East Rathong Glacier (ERG) of Sikkim Himalaya. Amplicon-based taxonomic classification revealed the dominance of the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and candidate Patescibacteria in the glacial sites. Further, eight good-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of Proteobacteria, Patescibacteria, Acidobacteriota, and Choloflexota retrieved from the metagenomes elucidated the microbial contributions to nutrient cycling. The ERG MAGs showed aerobic respiration as a primary metabolic feature, accompanied by carbon fixation and complex carbon degradation potentials. Pathways for nitrogen metabolism, chiefly dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification, and a complete sulphur oxidation enzyme complex for sulphur metabolism were identified in the MAGs. We observed that DNA repair and oxidative stress response genes complemented with osmotic and periplasmic stress and protein chaperones were vital for adaptation against the intense radiation and stress conditions of the extreme Himalayan niche. Current findings elucidate the microbiome and associated functional potentials of a vulnerable glacier, emphasizing their significant ecological roles in a changing glacial ecosystem. © The Author(s) 2024.

	abstract = {Biogeochemical cycles are fundamental processes that regulate the flow of essential elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, sustaining ecosystem productivity and global biogeochemical equilibrium. These cycles are intricately influenced by plant-microbe symbioses, which facilitate nutrient acquisition, organic matter decomposition, and the transformation of soil nutrients. Through mutualistic interactions, plants and microbes co-regulate nutrient availability and promote ecosystem resilience, especially under environmental stress. Metagenomics has emerged as a transformative tool for deciphering the complex microbial communities and functional genes driving these cycles. By enabling the high-throughput sequencing and annotation of microbial genomes, metagenomics provides unparalleled insights into the taxonomic diversity, metabolic potential, and functional pathways underlying microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes. Unlike previous reviews, this work integrates recent advancements in metagenomics with complementary omics approaches to provide a comprehensive perspective on how plant-microbe interactions modulate biogeochemical cycles at molecular, genetic, and ecosystem levels. By highlighting novel microbial processes and potential biotechnological applications, this review aims to guide future research in leveraging plant-microbe symbioses for sustainable agriculture, ecosystem restoration, and climate change mitigation. © 2024},

	abstract = {The fields of molecular evolution, genome evolution, and evolutionary genetics are now well-established. Remarkably, however, although all evolutionary modifications begin at the cellular level, and despite the advances made in cell biology and microbiology over the past few decades, there is as yet no recognised discipline of evolutionary cell biology. The goal of this book is to help establish the foundations for this emerging field. Its principal aims are twofold: firstly, to promote an understanding among evolutionary biologists as to why the cellular details matter if we are to understand the mechanisms of evolution; secondly, to make clear to non-evolutionary biologists -cell biologists in particular -that evolution is not just a matter of natural selection and optimization, but a process whose reach depends on other population genetic features such as mutation, recombination, and random genetic drift. Although there are many excellent books on cell biology, microbiology, and biophysics, almost no attention is given to evolution. Likewise, although there are numerous evolutionary biology books on the market, none of them gives more than passing attention to details at the cellular level. Thus Evolutionary Cell Biology is genuinely novel, offering a broader understanding of evolutionary processes and an appreciation for the many interesting problems that remain to be solved at the cellular and subcellular levels. This advanced textbook is aimed at both cell biologists and evolutionary biologists. It will be accessible to upper-level undergraduates in biology, and certainly to graduate students in all areas of the life sciences. Professionals from a wide range of fields -cell biology, microbiology, evolution, biophysics, biochemistry, and mathematics -will be exposed to entirely new ideas not traditionally covered in their primary fields of expertise. © Michael Lynch 2024.

	abstract = {Deep pristine aquifers are ecological hotspots with diverse microbial life, where microorganisms exist either attached (sessile) to solid substrates or suspended in groundwater (planktonic). Characterizing the attached microbial communities is of paramount importance, especially in the context of biofouling. However, obtaining samples of attached microbes that thrive under natural (undisturbed) conditions is challenging. Our study addresses this by retrieving sessile microbes on-site. We installed columns filled with site-specific rock cuttings at the wellhead, allowing fresh groundwater to flow continuously for approximately 60 days. We hypothesized that the attached microbial communities would differ structurally from planktonic microbes due to the aquifer’s lithological and mineralogical composition. This study involved an exploratory examination of the microbial communities in different aquifers with distinct mineralogies, including quartzitic sandstone, calcareous, chert, and highly heterogeneous (clastic) aquifers in Israel’s Negev Desert. Metagenomic analysis revealed both shared and distinct microbial communities among attached and planktonic forms in the various environments, likely shaped by the aquifers’ physical, lithological, and mineralogical properties. A wealth of carbon-fixation pathways and energy-conservation strategies in the attached microbiome provide evidence for the potential productivity of these biofilms. We identified widespread genetic potential for biofilm formation (e.g., via pili, flagella, and extracellular polymeric substance production) and the interactome (e.g., quorum-sensing genes).

	abstract = {It is currently unclear how Pseudomonadota, a phylum that originated around the time of the Great Oxidation Event, became one of the most abundant and diverse bacterial phyla on Earth, with metabolically versatile members colonizing a wide range of environments with different O2 concentrations. Here, we address this question by studying isoprenoid quinones, which are central components of energy metabolism covering a wide range of redox potentials. We demonstrate that a dynamic repertoire of quinone biosynthetic pathways accompanied the diversification of Pseudomonadota. The low potential menaquinone (MK) was lost in an ancestor of Pseudomonadota while the high potential ubiquinone (UQ) emerged. We show that the O2-dependent and O2-independent UQ pathways were both present in the last common ancestor of Pseudomonadota, and transmitted vertically. The O2-independent pathway has a conserved genetic organization and displays signs of positive regulation by the master regulator “fumarate and nitrate reductase” (FNR), suggesting a conserved role for UQ in anaerobiosis across Pseudomonadota. The O2-independent pathway was lost in some lineages but maintained in others, where it favoured a secondary reacquisition of low potential quinones (MK or rhodoquinone), which promoted diversification towards aerobic facultative and anaerobic metabolisms. Our results support that the ecological success of Pseudomonadota is linked to the acquisition of the largest known repertoire of quinones, which allowed adaptation to oxic niches as O2 levels increased on Earth, and subsequent diversification into anoxic or O2-fluctuating environments. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Groundwater harbors phylogenetically diverse Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria, representing an ideal ecosystem for studying this microbial dark matter. However, no CPR strains have been successfully isolated from groundwater, severely limiting further research. This study employed a multi-metagenome approach, integrating time-resolved sampling, antibiotic/nutrient interventions, and microbial correlation networks to unravel CPR ecological roles in groundwater and provide insights into their subsequent cultivation. Through 36 metagenomes from a groundwater system containing at least 68 CPR phyla, we revealed the time-sensitive collapse of CPR communities: total abundance plummeted from 7.9% to 0.15% within 48 h post-sampling, driven by competition with rapidly dividing non-CPR bacteria, such as members of Pseudomonadota. Ampicillin (100 mg/L) stabilized CPR communities by suppressing competitors, whereas low-nutrient conditions paradoxically reversed this effect. Long-term enrichment (14 months) recovered 63 CPR phyla (0.35% abundance), revealing their survival resilience despite nutrient deprivation. Correlation networks prioritized Actinomyces, a novel Acidimicrobiaceae genus, Aestuariivirga, Baekduia and Caedimonadaceae as potential CPR partners, providing actionable targets for co-culture trials. Here, we propose actionable recommendations spanning groundwater sampling, activation status, identification of CPR symbiotic partners, and optimization of culture conditions, which bypass traditional blind cultivation and are critical for future efforts to cultivate CPR bacterial strains from groundwater. Cultivating CPR bacteria will contribute to clarifying their diversity, ecological roles, evolutionary mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and genetic potential. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Elemental sulfur is widely used in fungicide applications to control crop diseases in agricultural systems, but its effects on soil microbial communities are largely unknown. In China, significant amounts of elemental sulfur are sprayed annually on rubber plantations to support crop performance. To investigate the effects of sulfur spraying on microbial diversity, composition, interactions, and functionalities in rubber plantation soil, soil samples from rubber plantations in Yunnan, South China, were collected, and bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed through high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that sulfur application did not alter the alpha diversity but the beta diversity of the soil bacterial community. Notably, sulfur disturbed the relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes. Certain bacteria (e.g., Bacillus and Sinomonas) thrived under sulfur treatment, influencing nutrient cycling. The ecological network analysis revealed enhanced bacterial and fungal interconnections. Sulfur application had a limited impact on microbial phenotypes and community functions, yet it inhibited sulfur compound respiration. These findings indicate that sulfur spraying can shift microbial community composition and influence nutrient cycling by favoring specific microbial groups. Despite its limited impact on microbial phenotypes, sulfur affects key metabolic processes, such as sulfur respiration, which are vital for soil health and microbial activity. The results highlight the need for sustainable sulfur management to optimize nutrient cycling and soil health on rubber plantations. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Biomining is a sustainable alternative to conventional mineral processing that uses acidophilic microorganisms to catalyze the extraction of valuable metals from sulfide minerals. Mixed microbial consortia composed of moderate thermophiles such as Sulfobacillus and some Leptospirillum species improve metal extraction efficiency at higher temperatures compared to pure cultures of mesophiles. However, quorum sensing (QS), which regulates microbial interactions and likely influences bioleaching performance, has not been studied in these species. In this study, treatment of a moderately thermophilic biomining consortium with QS compounds, termed diffusible signal factors (DSF), reduced pyrite and chalcopyrite dissolution via an inhibitory effect on iron oxidation and mineral colonization by the mixed culture. Furthermore, QS molecules changed the distribution of planktonic/mineral subpopulations of the acidophilic species. In addition, DSF compounds induced Acidithiobacillus caldus motility and dispersion from pyrite with a concomitant expansion of Leptospirillum ferriphilum on the mineral surface while in contrast, the acyl-homoserine lactone mediated QS system repressed L. ferriphilum motility. Moreover, the addition of QS molecules induced a second response related to the detrimental effect of high concentrations of fatty acids on cells, with an activation of detoxification mechanisms. Overall, QS regulated key target microbial interactions that opens the possibility to improve chalcopyrite bioleaching in the studied consortia.

	abstract = {A novel bacterial strain, HK31-GT, was isolated from a subsurface geothermal aquifer (Hellisheidi, SW-Iceland) and was characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene along with phylogenomic position indicated that the novel strain belongs to the genus Phenylobacterium. Cells are motile Gram-negative thin rods. Physiological characterization showed that strain HK31-GT is a mesophilic bacterium able to grow from 10 to 30 °C, at pH values between 6 and 8 and at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 0.5 %. Optimal growth was observed without sodium chloride at 25 °C and pH 6. Strain HK31-GT is chemoorganoheterotroph and its major saturated fatty acids are C18:1ω7c, C16:1ω6c and C16:0, the predominant quinone is Q-10 and the major polar lipid is phosphatidylglycerol. The new strain also possesses the capacity to use ferrous iron (Fe(II)) as the sole energy source and can also be considered as a chemolithoautotrophic microorganism. The overall genome of strain HK31-GT was estimated to be 4.46 Mbp in size with a DNA G + C content of 67.95 %. Genes involved in iron metabolism were identified, but no genes typically involved in Fe(II)-oxidation were found. According to the overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI) values, six MAGs from groundwater have been assigned to the same species as the new strain HK31-GT. Furthermore, OGRI values between the genome of strain HK31-GT and the genomes of its closest relatives are below the species delineation threshold. Therefore, given the polyphasic approach used, strain HK31-GT represents a novel species of the genus Phenylobacterium, for which the name Phenylobacterium ferrooxidans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HK31-GT (DSM 116432T = UBOCC-M-3429T = LMG 33376T). © 2024},

In the present study, we isolated 648 strains using a dilution plating method after enrichment for low-nutrient conditions. We collected 150 seawater samples at 21 stations in different parts of the water column at the Zhenbei Seamount in the South China Sea. The 648 isolated copiotrophic strains that could grow on low-nutrient medium were in 21 genera and 42 species. A total of 99.4% (644/648) of the bacteria were in the phylum Pseudomonadota, with 73.3% (472/644) in the class Gammaproteobacteria and 26.7% (172/644) in the class Alphaproteobacteria. Among the 42 representative isolates, Pseudoalteromonas arabiensis, Roseibium aggregatum, and Vibrio neocaledonicus were present in all layers of seawater and at almost all of the stations. Almost half of these species (20/42) contained genes that performed nitrate reduction, with confirmation by nitrate reduction testing. These isolates also contained genes that functioned in sulfur metabolism, including sulfate reduction, thiosulfate oxidation, thiosulfate disproportionation, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation. GH23, CBM50, GT4, GT2, and GT51 were the main carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and these five enzymes were present in all or almost all of the isolated strains. The most abundant classes of CAZymes were those associated with the degradation of chitin, starch, and cellulose. Collectively, our study of marine copiotrophic bacteria capable of growing on low-nutrient medium demonstrated the diversity of these species and their potential metabolic characteristics. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities exhibit intricate interactions underpinned by metabolic dependencies. To elucidate these dependencies, we present a workflow utilizing random matrix theory on metagenome-assembled genomes to construct co-occurrence and metabolic complementarity networks. We apply this approach to a temperature gradient hot spring, unraveling the interplay between thermal stress and metabolic cooperation. Our analysis reveals an increase in the frequency of metabolic interactions with rising temperatures. Amino acids, coenzyme A derivatives, and carbohydrates emerge as key exchange metabolites, forming the foundation for syntrophic dependencies, in which commensalistic interactions take a greater proportion than mutualistic ones. These metabolic exchanges are most prevalent between phylogenetically distant species, especially archaea-bacteria collaborations, as a crucial adaptation to harsh environments. Furthermore, we identify a significant positive correlation between basal metabolite exchange and genome size disparity, potentially signifying a means for streamlined genomes to leverage cooperation with metabolically richer partners. This phenomenon is also confirmed by another composting system which has a similar wide range of temperature fluctuations. Our workflow provides a feasible way to decipher the metabolic complementarity mechanisms underlying microbial interactions, and our findings suggested environmental stress regulates the cooperative strategies of thermophiles, while these dependencies have been potentially hardwired into their genomes during co-evolutions. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Acidophiles play a key role in the generation, evolution and attenuation of acid mine drainage (AMD), which is characterized by strong acidity (pH<3.5) and high metal concentrations. In this study, the seasonal changes of acidophilic communities and their roles in elemental cycling in an AMD lake (pH∼3.0) in China were analyzed through metagenomics. The results showed eukaryotic algae thrived in the lake, and Coccomyxa was dominant in January (38.1%) and May (33.9%), while Chlorella in July (9.5%). The extensive growth of Chlamydomonas in December (22.7%) resulted in an ultrahigh chlorophyll a concentration (587 μg/L), providing abundant organic carbon for the ecosystem. In addition, the iron-oxidizing and nitrogen-fixing bacterium Ferrovum contributed to carbon fixation. Ammonia oxidation likely occurred in the acidic lake, as was revealed by archaea Ca. Nitrosotalea. To gain a competitive advantage in the nutrient-poor environment, some acidophiles exhibited facultative characteristics, e.g. the most abundant bacterium Acidiphilium utilized both organic and inorganic carbon, and obtained energy from organic matter, inorganic sulfur, and sunlight simultaneously. It was suggested that sunlight, rather than chemical energy of reduced iron-sulfur was the major driver of elemental cycling in the AMD lake. The results are beneficial to the development of bioremediation strategies for AMD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Extreme acidophiles from the Acidithiobacillia class thrive in highly acidic environments where they rely on diverse regulatory mechanisms for adaptation. These mechanisms include sigma factors, transcription factors (TFs), and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), which control essential pathways. Comparative genomics and bioinformatics analyses identified sigma factors and TFs in Acidithiobacillia, showing similarities but key differences from reference neutrophiles. This study highlights sigma54-dependent one- and two-component systems that are crucial for survival in energy acquisition from sulfur compounds and hydrogen as well as nutrient assimilation. Furthermore, the data suggested evolutionary divergence in regulatory elements distinguishes S-oxidizing from Fe-S-oxidizing members of Acidithiobacillia. Conservation of gene clusters, synteny, and phylogenetic analyses supported the expected phenotypes in each species. Notable examples include HupR’s role in hydrogenase-2 oxidation in Fe-S-oxidizers, TspR/TspS regulation of the sulfur oxidation complex, and FleR/FleS control of flagellar motility in S-oxidizers. These regulatory mechanisms act as master controllers of bacterial activity, reflecting adaptation to distinct metabolic needs within Acidithiobacillia. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {To investigate their roles in extracellular electron transfer (EET), the porin-cytochrome (pcc) gene clusters Gmet0825-0828, Gmet0908-0910, and Gmet0911-0913 of the Gram-negative bacterium Geobacter metallireducens were deleted. Failure to delete all pcc gene clusters at the same time suggested their essential roles in extracellular reduction of Fe(III)-citrate by G. metallireducens. Deletion of Gmet0825-0828 had no impact on bacterial reduction of Fe(III)-citrate but diminished bacterial reduction of ferrihydrite and abolished anode reduction and direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) to Methanosarcina barkeri and Geobacter sulfurreducens. Although it had no impact on the bacterial reduction of Fe(III)-citrate, deletion of Gmet0908-0910 delayed ferrihydrite reduction, abolished anode reduction, and diminished DIET. Deletion of Gmet0911-0913 had little impact on DIET but diminished bacterial reductions of Fe(III)-citrate, ferrihydrite, and anodes. Most importantly, deletions of both Gmet0825-0828 and Gmet0908-0910 restored bacterial reduction of ferrihydrite and anodes and DIET. Enhanced expression of Gmet0911-0913 in this double mutant when grown in coculture with G. sulfurreducens ΔhybLΔfdnG suggested that this cluster might compensate for impaired EET functions of deleting Gmet0825-0828 and Gmet0908-0910. Thus, these pcc gene clusters played essential, distinct, overlapping, and compensatory roles in EET of G. metallireducens that are difficult to characterize as deletion of some clusters affected expression of others. The robustness of these pcc gene clusters enabled G. metallireducens to mediate EET to different acceptors for anaerobic growth even when two of its three pcc gene clusters were inactivated by mutation. The results from this investigation provide new insights into the roles of pcc gene clusters in bacterial EET. Copyright © 2024 Zhuo et al.},

	abstract = {Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), non-biting midges, are a highly diverse family of holometabolous insects, many of which are known for their tolerance to extreme environmental conditions, such as desiccation, pollution, and high acidity. The contribution of microbial symbionts to these adaptations was recently suggested. Therefore, we herein examined the microbiome associated with the larvae of the undescribed acid-tolerant chironomid species, Polypedilum sp., which inhabits the Yukawa River (Gunma, Japan), an environment that is characterized by an extremely low pH (≤2) and high concentrations of heavy metal ions (including arsenic). Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a distinct larval microbiome with a lower alpha diversity value and more enriched and specific bacterial taxa than the surrounding river water and detritus. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing using nanopore long-read technology identified several previously undescribed operational taxonomic units (OTUs), among which OTU_Bacillaceae_Yukawa was consistently present in larvae reared in the laboratory for more than 4 months, suggesting persistent, possibly vertically transmitted, symbiosis. An inferred pathway analysis suggested the contribution of the larval microbiome to host nutritional physiology. The possibly acid-sensitive OTU_Bacillaceae_Y ukawa localized to midgut segments, indicating internal pH-buffered niches for microbial survival. These results provide novel insights into the ecology of acid-tolerant chironomids and lay the groundwork for further examinations of holobiont-based stress tolerance. © Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology.},

	abstract = {Objective] The isolation and comparative genomic analysis of Acidithiobacillus capable of oxidizing sulfur will enrich our knowledge about not only sulfur-oxidizing bacterial strains but also the molecular evolution and ecological adaptation mechanisms of Acidithiobacillus. [Methods] The medium with sodium thiosulfate as the sole energy source was used to isolate the strain capable of oxidizing sulfur, which was followed by Illumina HiSeq X and Oxford Nanopore sequencing of strain M4-422-6. Bioinformatics tools were used for sequence assembly and gene annotation, and the comparative genomic analysis was performed with Ignacidithiobacillus copahuensis VAN18-1. [Results] An Acidithiobacillus strain M4-422-6 capable of oxidizing sulfur was isolated. The genome annotation results showed that the genome of strain M4-422-6 consisted of one chromosome and two plasmids, with a length of 2 917 823 bp and G+C content of 58.54%, encoding a total of 2 925 proteins. The 16S rRNA gene sequence and the phylogenetic tree built by the type (strain) genome server (TYGS) revealed that strain M4-422-6 represented a novel species of Acidithiobacillus. Functional gene annotation showed that strain M4-422-6 carried numerous genes involved in sulfur oxidation, CO2 fixation, and acid resistance. The comparative genomic analysis revealed that although strain M4-422-6 had the closest genetic relationship with Ignacidithiobacillus copahuensis VAN18-1, and the two strains possessed numerous different genes, which were mainly involved in phage resistance and mobile element encoding. [Conclusion] Strain M4-422-6 represents a novel species of Acidithiobacillus and has unique genes that are not present in strains of the same species. Therefore, we hypothesize that the intra-species differentiation of Acidithiobacillus can be attributed to adaptation to specific niches. © 2024, Acta Microbiologica Sinica Editorial Office.

Acidithiobacillus could accelerate the rate of AMD formation by 5-6 orders of magnitude. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A. ferrooxidans) is the model species of Acidithiobacillus. We initially tried to use the biogas slurry as an organic additive to prevent AMD formation. We determined the essential inhibitory components of the biogas slurry as organic acids (acetic acid (AA), a typical example). The results revealed that AA (≥50 ppm) prevented A. ferrooxidans from forming AMD. The transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomic evaluation found 324 differentially expressed genes and 35 significantly transformed metabolites. Combinatorial omics analysis showed that the presence of AA significantly inhibited the membrane biogenesis, Fe2+, and RISC metabolism pathways, reducing energy metabolites such as Fe3+ and SO42-. Furthermore, AA treatment induced A. ferrooxidans defense mechanisms and overconsumed its internal carbon sources. These findings proved that biogas slurry had a significant inhibitory effect on key microorganisms in highly acidified mineral soils and provided a scientific foundation for the prevention of acidification and the ecological restoration of newly mined areas. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

The quality of these models is hidden because of the limited availability of genomic information and genome-scale metabolic reconstruction methods. In this review, 237 manually curated genome-scale models for various organisms with industrial and clinical significance were comprehensively reviewed, and their modelling information was tabulated based on literature. This review provides a comprehensive summary of potential applications of systems biology in biotechnology and biomedical research. Their broad applicability has been explored in the process of model improvement and design of experiments in metabolic design and drug development. This review summarizes their recent advances, challenges, and practical applications in Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, plants, and animals. Genome-scale models of microbes have been reviewed to address their various applications in metabolic systems engineering, strain optimization, bioremediation, biomanufacturing, and personalized systems medicine. Several models have been explored to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, virulence, host-microbe interactions, and metabolic crosstalk. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on human metabolic reconstructions and their important roles in human, microbiota-related, and complex metabolic disorders. Genome-scale models of human and animal metals offer ethical alternatives to the traditional animal testing methods.

	abstract = {The acidification of sulfidic mine tailings, driven primarily by sulfur- and iron-oxidizing microorganisms, can lead to severe environmental pollution and imperil human health. The role of viruses in this process and its underlying mechanisms yet remain poorly understood. In this study, we recovered 623 species-level viral genomes and 322 prokaryotic genomes from seven metagenomes of mine tailings with pH values ranging from 7.51 to 2.13. We observed that acidification drastically altered geochemical properties and degraded environmental quality, characterized by significant decreases in carbon/nitrogen ratio and heavy metal levels. The structure and function of viral communities were significantly correlated with pH and prokaryotic diversity, showing distinct dynamics across different acidification stages, similar to patterns observed in the prokaryotic community. Notably, potential sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes increased in relative abundance as pH declined, while their virus-host abundance ratio exhibited a significant positive correlation with pH. Results indicated that viral “top-down” predation on sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes was likely suppressed during acidification, providing a survival advantage to these organisms over iron-oxidizing counterparts. Moreover, viruses likely reprogrammed the sulfur and iron metabolism of prokaryotic hosts and enhanced their adaptability to environmental stressors through auxiliary metabolic genes. Additionally, a pH- and lifestyle-dependent evolutionary scenario for viruses revealed that frequent recombination and the accumulation of synonymous mutations in lytic viruses and chronic Inoviridae, likely increased their intrapopulation diversity and resilience. These findings provide new insights into the multifaceted roles of viruses in mine tailings acidification, deepening understanding of the underlying mechanisms and advancing potential strategies to mitigate associated environmental risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the responses of the bacterial community structure and metabolic pathways in a sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification filter (SADF) system to fast elevated sulfate salinity, from 0.04 to 1.2% in 30 days. Results showed that the SADF system exhibited robust sulfate salinity stress tolerance at low nitrate concentrations. In the context of sulfate scenarios, the genus Thiobacillus significantly proliferated and was identified as the dominant sulfur-oxidizing player in the SADF system, achieving a relative abundance of 63.79% under 1.2% sulfate salinity. Cooperative and competitive interactions were found in the SADF-related microorganisms, promoting stable denitrification performance under high salinity. Surprisingly, with a low hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 60 min, metagenomic sequencing revealed a upregulated abundance of functional genes encoding for enzymes associated with nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, while positive correlations were observed between these two pathways in response to sulfate salinity. Furthermore, global wastewater treatment plants were thoroughly explored for the distribution of the SADF-related microorganisms identified in this study. Interestingly, one-way ANOVA analysis showed that the SADF-related microorganisms were widely distributed globally, demonstrating their universality in potential engineering applications worldwide.

	abstract = {Background: Rumen microbial community structure and stability are very important for ruminant health, growth and development, and livestock product yield. Dietary composition and nutritional structure affect microbial diversity and richness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different fiber levels of energy feed on the rumen microflora and fermentation function of grazing sheep in salinized sown pasture, to reveal the response of the main microflora of sheep rumen at the phylum and genus levels to different fiber levels of energy feed and to analyze the internal mechanism to provide a reference for the selection of energy feed and the improvement of the production performance of grazing livestock. Results: The fiber level of energy feed affects the rumen fermentation and rumen microbial community structure of grazing sheep. Low-fiber-energy feeds significantly increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, while the relative abundances of Cyanobacteria, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_010, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, and Elusimicrobium significantly decreased, adjusting the relationship between the flora toward cooperation. High-fiber-energy feeds significantly increased the concentration of VFAs, significantly decreased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, adjusted the relationship between the flora to compete, and promoted the enrichment of metabolic pathways such as "Protein Digestion and Absorption," "Nitrogen Metabolism," "Starch and Sucrose Metabolism," and "Degradation of Other Sugars." Conclusions: Supplementary feeding of high and low fiber energy feeds reduced the pH value of rumen fluid and the richness and diversity of microorganisms in grazing sheep, reduced the relative abundance of some harmful microorganisms, affected the metabolic activities of some fiber-digesting bacteria, regulated the interaction and competition between bacteria, increased the content of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and the relative abundance of metabolic-related microorganisms in the supplementary feeding group, and enriched the metabolic-related pathways. However, further understand the mechanism of the effect of fiber level on the rumen of sheep, it is necessary to conduct in-depth analysis using research methods such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Iron-sulfur clusters serve as indispensable cofactors within proteins across all three domains of life. Fe/S clusters emerged early during the evolution of life on our planet and the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur is one of the most ancient and important element cycles. It is therefore no surprise that Fe/S proteins have crucial roles in the multiple steps of microbial sulfur metabolism. During dissimilatory sulfur oxidation in prokaryotes, Fe/S proteins not only serve as electron carriers in several steps, but also perform catalytic roles, including unprecedented reactions. Two cytoplasmic enzyme systems that oxidize sulfane sulfur to sulfite are of particular interest in this context: The rDsr pathway employs the reverse acting dissimilatory sulfite reductase rDsrAB as its key enzyme, while the sHdr pathway utilizes polypeptides resembling the HdrA, HdrB and HdrC subunits of heterodisulfide reductase from methanogenic archaea. Both pathways involve components predicted to bind unusual noncubane Fe/S clusters acting as catalysts for the formation of disulfide or sulfite. Mapping of Fe/S cluster machineries on the sulfur-oxidizing prokaryote tree reveals that ISC, SUF, MIS and SMS are all sufficient to meet the Fe/S cluster maturation requirements for operation of the sHdr or rDsr pathways. The sHdr pathway is dependent on lipoate-binding proteins that are assembled by a novel pathway, involving two Radical SAM proteins, namely LipS1 and LipS2. These proteins coordinate sulfur-donating auxiliary Fe/S clusters in atypical patterns by three cysteines and one histidine and act as lipoyl synthases by jointly inserting two sulfur atoms to an octanoyl residue. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Biogenesis and Function of Fe/S proteins. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Bacterial reverse transcriptase coding gene (RT) is essential for the production of a small satellite DNA-RNA complex called multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). In this study, we found a novel retron, retron-Vmi1 (Vm85) from Vibrio mimicus. The retron is comprised of the msr-msd region, orf323, and the ret gene, a genetic organization similar to Salmonella's retron-Sen2 (St85). The protein sequence of the RNA-directed DNA polymerase (RT-Vmi1) is highly homologous to the RTs of Vibrio metoecus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus. Phylogenetic and protein sequence similarity analysis of retron-Vmi1 ORF323 and RT revealed a close relatedness to retron-Sen2. We found that retron-Vmi1 was inserted in the dusA gene, similar to the insertion of the retron-Vpa1 (Vp96) of V. parahaemolyticus AQ3354, suggesting that retrons can be transferred via the tRNA gene. These results are the first convincing evidence that retron is moving across species. The neighboring genes of retron-Vmi1 shared high homology with the genetic environment of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus retrons. We also found two junction points within the retron-Vmi1 and the dusA gene suggesting that retron-Vmi1 was inserted into this site in a two-step manner. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Af.) is a microorganism of significant biotechnological interest that thrives in acidic environments with very high concentrations of soluble iron. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that enable its survival in these extreme conditions is of great scientific relevance and practical importance for bioleaching of precious metals. Central to its metabolism is the Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur), a protein that regulates iron homeostasis and responses to oxidative stress in bacteria. Using a combination of bioinformatics, experimental, and spectroscopic methodologies, this study identified and characterized the metal binding sites and cofactors relevant to AfFur´s function. Three metal-binding sites became evident, two of which are very similar to those found in other members of the superfamily. The third site, formed by four cysteine residues in a configuration CX2C-Xn-CX8C, stably binds an iron-sulfur cluster. Site-directed mutagenesis coupled with Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays underscored the essentiality of these cysteines for AfFur's functionality, particularly in DNA binding. Altogether, the findings from this research suggest the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster, which may play a role in fine-tuning iron sensing, particularly adapted to the unique environment of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Microbial communities as the most important and active component of soil play a crucial role in the geochemical cycling of toxic metal(loid)s in the Pb and Zn smelting site soils. However, the relationships between soil microbial communities and the fractions of toxic metal(loid)s and the succession of soil microbial community and functions after enrichment cultivation have rarely been analyzed. In this study, the diversity and composition of microbial communities in soils before and after enrichment cultivation were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. And the co-occurrence relationships between soil microbial community after enrichment cultivation and MRGs genes were also analyzed through the BacMet database. Results showed that the dominant genus in the soils was Lactobacillus and Stenotrophomonas. The soil microbial community exhibited a notable correlation with Cd, Pb, and As, among which Cd exerted the most profound impact. Alishewanella, Pseudomonas, Massilia and Roseibacillus were significantly correlated with the fraction of Cd. After enrichment cultivation, the number of genera decrease to 96. And the dominant genus changed to Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Comamonas, Lysobacter, and Pseudoxanthomonas. High abundance of metal resistance genes (MRGs) including zntA, fpvA, zipB, cadA, czcA, czcB, czcC, zntA, arsR, pstS and pstB was found in the microbial community after enrichment cultivation. The potential host genus for MRGs was Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Lysinibacillus, Azotobacter, Bacillus, Lysobacter, Cupriavidus, Pseudoxanthomonas, and Thermomonas. Additionally, these microbial community after enrichment cultivation possessing pathways of bacterial chemotaxis and two-component systems was enabled them to adapt to the polluted environment. These observations provided potential guidance for microbe isolation and the development of strategies for the bioremediation of toxic metal(loid)s polluted soils. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Plasmid-encoded type IV-A CRISPR-Cas systems lack an acquisition module, feature a DinG helicase instead of a nuclease, and form ribonucleoprotein complexes of unknown biological functions. Type IV-A3 systems are carried by conjugative plasmids that often harbor antibiotic-resistance genes and their CRISPR array contents suggest a role in mediating inter-plasmid conflicts, but this function remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that a plasmid-encoded type IV-A3 system co-opts the type I-E adaptation machinery from its host, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), to update its CRISPR array. Furthermore, we reveal that robust interference of conjugative plasmids and phages is elicited through CRISPR RNA-dependent transcriptional repression. By silencing plasmid core functions, type IV-A3 impacts the horizontal transfer and stability of targeted plasmids, supporting its role in plasmid competition. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms and ecological function of type IV-A3 systems and demonstrate their practical efficacy for countering antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant strains. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {End-of-life (EoL) mobile phones represent a valuable reservoir of critical raw materials at higher concentrations compared to primary ores. This review emphasizes the critical need to transition from single-material recovery approaches to comprehensive, holistic strategies for recycling EoL mobile phones. In response to the call for sustainable techniques with reduced energy consumption and pollutant emissions, biohydrometallurgy emerges as a promising solution. The present work intends to review the most relevant studies focusing on the exploitation of microbial consortia in bioleaching and biorecovery processes. All living organisms need macro- and micronutrients for their metabolic functionalities, including some of the elements contained in mobile phones. By exploring the interactions between microbial communities and the diverse elements found in mobile phones, this paper establishes a microbial-centric perspective by connecting each element of each layer to their role in the microbial cell system. A special focus is dedicated to the concepts of ecodesign and modularity as key requirements in electronics to potentially increase selectivity of microbial consortia in the bioleaching process. By bridging microbial science with sustainable design, this review proposes an innovative roadmap to optimize metal recovery, aligning with the principles of the circular economy and advancing scalable biotechnological solutions for electronic waste management. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for eco-friendly technologies in biotechnology necessitates effective and sustainable catalysts. Acidophilic proteins, functioning optimally in highly acidic environments, hold immense promise for various applications, including food production, biofuels, and bioremediation. However, limited knowledge about these proteins hinders their exploration. This study addresses this gap by employing in silico methods utilizing computational tools and machine learning. We propose a novel approach to predict acidophilic proteins using protein language models (PLMs), accelerating discovery without extensive lab work. Our investigation highlights the potential of PLMs in understanding and harnessing acidophilic proteins for scientific and industrial advancements. We introduce the ACE model, which combines a simple Logistic Regression model with embeddings derived from protein sequences processed by the ProtT5 PLM. This model achieves high performance on an independent test set, with accuracy (0.91), F1-score (0.93), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (0.76). To our knowledge, this is the first application of pre-trained PLM embeddings for acidophilic protein classification. The ACE model serves as a powerful tool for exploring protein acidophilicity, paving the way for future advancements in protein design and engineering. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Strain S30A2T, isolated from the acid mine drainage sediment of Mengzi Copper Mine, Yunnan, is proposed to represent a novel species of the sulphur-oxidizing genus Acidithiobacillus. Cells were Gram-stain-negative, non-endospore forming, highly motile with one or two monopolar flagella and rod-shaped. The strain was mesophilic, growing at 30–50 °C (optimum, 38 °C), acidophilic, growing at pH 2.0–4.5 (optimum, pH 2.5), and tolerant of 0–4 % (w/v; 684 mol l−1) NaCl. The 16S rRNA gene-based sequence analysis showed that strain S30A2T belongs to the genus Acidithiobacillus and shows the largest similarity of 96.6 % to the type strain Acidithiobacillus caldus KUT. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain S30A2T was 59.25 mol%. The average nucleotide identity ANIb and ANIm values between strain S30A2T and A. caldus KUT were 70.95 and 89.78 %, respectively and the digital DNA–DNA hybridization value was 24.9 %. Strain S30A2T was strictly aerobic and could utilize elementary sulphur and tetrathionate to support chemolithotrophic growth. The major cellular fatty acid of S30A2T was C19: 1 ω7c. The respiratory quinones were ubiquinone-8 and ubiquinone-7. Based upon its phylogenetic, genetic, phenotypic, physiologic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain S30A2T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Acidithiobacillus, for which the name Acidithiobacillus acidisediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is S30A2T (=CGMCC 1.17059T=KCTC 72580T). © 2023 The Authors.},

Photosynthetic biofilms are a major biological feature of hot springs but despite this large-scale studies are scarce, leaving critical questions about the drivers of spatial turnover unanswered. Here, we analysed 395 photosynthetic biofilms from neutral-alkaline hot springs (39–66 °C, pH 6.4–9.0) across a 2100 km latitudinal gradient in Southeast Asia. The Cyanobacteria-dominated communities were categorized into six biogeographic regions, each characterized by a distinct core microbiome and biotic interactions. We observed a significant decline in the explanatory power of major abiotic variables with increasing spatial scale, from 62.6% locally, 55% regionally, to 26.8% for the inter-regional meta-community. Statistical null models revealed that deterministic environmental filtering predominated at local and regional scales, whereas stochastic ecological drift was more influential at the inter-regional scale. These findings enhance our understanding of the differential contribution of ecological drivers and highlight the importance of spatial scale in shaping biogeographic distributions for microorganisms. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are ubiquitously distributed across various biospheres and play key roles in global sulfur and carbon cycles. However, few deep-sea SRB have been cultivated and studied in situ, limiting our understanding of the true metabolism of deep-sea SRB. Here, we firstly clarified the high abundance of SRB in deep-sea sediments and successfully isolated a sulfate-reducing bacterium (zrk46) from a cold seep sediment. Our genomic, physiological, and phylogenetic analyses indicate that strain zrk46 is a novel species, which we propose as Pseudodesulfovibrio serpens. We found that supplementation with sulfate, thiosulfate, or sulfite promoted strain zrk46 growth by facilitating energy production through the dissimilatory sulfate reduction, which was coupled to the oxidation of organic matter in both laboratory and deep-sea conditions. Moreover, in situ metatranscriptomic results confirmed that other deep-sea SRB also performed the dissimilatory sulfate reduction, strongly suggesting that SRB may play undocumented roles in deep-sea sulfur cycling. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Abstract: The cysteine residues of Keap1 such as C151, C273, and C288 are critical for its repressor activity on Nrf2. However, to date, no molecules have been identified to covalently modify all three cysteine residues for Nrf2 activation. Hence, in this study, our goal is to discover new Keap1 covalent inhibitors that can undergo a Michael addition with all three cysteine residues. The Keap1’s intervening region was modeled using Modeller v10.4. Covalent docking and binding free energy were calculated using CovDock. Molecular dynamics (MD) was performed using Desmond. Various in-vitro assays were carried out to confirm the neuroprotective effects of the hit molecule in 6-OHDA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Further, the best hit was evaluated in vivo for its ability to improve rotenone-induced postural instability and cognitive impairment in male rats. Finally, network pharmacology was used to summarize the complete molecular mechanism of the hit molecule. Chalcone and plumbagin were found to form the necessary covalent bonds with all three cysteine residues. However, MD analysis indicated that the binding of plumbagin is more stable than chalcone. Plumbagin displayed neuroprotective effects in 6-OHDA-treated SH-SY5Y cells at concentrations 0.01 and 0.1 μM. Plumbagin at 0.1 µM had positive effects on reactive oxygen species formation and glutathione levels. Plumbagin also improved postural instability and cognitive impairment in rotenone-treated male rats. Our network analysis indicated that plumbagin could also improve dopamine signaling. Additionally, plumbagin could exhibit anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity through the activation of Nrf2. Cumulatively, our study suggests that plumbagin is a novel Keap1 covalent inhibitor for Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection in PD. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Metallosphaera sedula is a thermoacidophilic archaeon that obtains all of its energy for growth from aerobic respiration and oxidative phosphorylation at the expense of selected organic and inorganic sources of electrons. Initial velocities for the oxidation of soluble ferrous ions by intact cells at 60 °C and pH 1.5 were determined using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted accurate absorbance measurements to quantify the increase in soluble ferric iron in the presence of turbid suspensions of the live organisms. M. sedula that was cultured on yeast extract either in the absence or the presence of 20 mM soluble ferrous iron exhibited turnover numbers for soluble iron oxidation of 304 ± 26 and 333 ± 31 attamoles/cell/min, respectively. These functional data were consistent with the transcriptomic evidence presented by others, that the proteins presumably responsible for aerobic respiration on soluble iron are expressed constitutively in M. sedula. Intact cells of M. sedula were characterized by electrical impedance, laser light diffraction, and transmission electron microscopic measurements. All three types of measurements were consistent with the surprising observation that cells cultured on yeast extract in the presence of soluble iron bifurcated into approximately equal numbers of coccoidal cells of two sizes, smaller cells with an average diameter of 0.6 μm and larger cells with an average diameter of 1.35 μm. Cells cultured on the same concentration of yeast extract but in the absence of soluble iron comprised a single cell size with an intermediate average diameter of 1.06 μm. This unexpected bifurcation of a clonal cell population into two demonstrably different sizes when the extracellular nutrient environment changes has not previously been reported for M. sedula, or any other single-celled archaeon or eubacterium.

	abstract = {Halotolerant, acidophilic, bioleaching microorganisms are crucial to biomining operations that utilize saline water. Compatible solutes play an important role in the adaptation of these microorganisms to saline environments. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270, an iron- and sulfur-oxidizing acidophilic bacterium, synthesizes trehalose as its native compatible solute but is still sensitive to salinity. Recently, halotolerant bioleaching bacteria were found to use ectoine as their key compatible solute. Previously, bioleaching bacteria were recalcitrant to genetic manipulation; however, recent advancements in genetic tools and techniques allow successful genetic modification of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. Therefore, this study aimed to test, in silico, the effect of native and synthetic compatible solute biosynthesis by A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 on its growth and metabolism. Metabolic network flux modelling was used to provide a computational framework for the prediction of metabolic fluxes during production of native and synthetic compatible solutes by A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270, in silico. Complete pathways for trehalose biosynthesis by the bacterium are proposed and captured in the updated metabolic model including a newly discovered UDP-dependent trehalose synthesis pathway. Finally, the effect of nitrogen sources on compatible solute production was simulated and showed that using nitrogen gas as the sole nitrogen source enables the ectoine-producing ‘engineered’ microbe to oxidize up to 20% more ferrous iron in comparison to the native microbe that only produces trehalose. Therefore, the predictive outcomes of the model have the potential to guide the design and optimization of a halotolerant strain of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 for saline bioleaching operations. © 2023 The Authors},

This strain is a magnetotactic bacterium producing magnetite nanocrystals aligned in one chain per cell. Strain SS-5T is a microaerophile that grows chemolithoautotrophically while reducing oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. Optimal growth occurred at pH 7.0–7.3 and 28–36 °C with thiosulfate used as an electron donor and sodium bicarbonate as a carbon source. Based on its genome sequence, the G + C content is 61.6 %. Phylogenomic and phylogenetic analyses indicate that strain SS-5T belongs to the Sedimenticolaceae family within the Gammaproteobacteria class. Based on average amino acid identity, strain SS-5T can be considered as a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Magnetovirga frankeli is proposed.

	abstract = {Thirty years since the first report on the PilY1 protein in bacteria, only the C-terminal domain has been crystallized; there is no study in which the N-terminal domain, let alone the complete protein, has been crystallized. In our laboratory, we are interested in characterizing the Type IV Pili (T4P) of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. We performed an in silico characterization of PilY1 and other pilins of the T4P of this acidophilic bacterium. In silico characterization is crucial for understanding how proteins adapt and function under extreme conditions. By analyzing the primary and secondary structures of proteins through computational methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into protein stability, key structural features, and unique amino acid compositions that contribute to resilience in harsh environments. Here, it is presented a description of the particularities of At. thiooxidans PilY1 through predictor software and homology data. Our results suggest that PilY1 from At. thiooxidans may have the same role as has been described for other PilY1 associated with T4P in neutrophilic bacteria; also, its C-terminal interacts (interface interaction) with the minor pilins PilX, PilW and PilV. The N-terminal region comprises domains such as the vWA and the MIDAS, involved in signaling, ligand-binding, and protein-protein interaction. In fact, the vWA domain has intrinsically disordered regions that enable it to maintain its structure over a wide pH range, not only at extreme acidity to which At. thiooxidans is adapted. The results obtained helped us design the correct methodology for its heterologous expression. This allowed us partially experimentally characterize it by obtaining the N-terminal domain recombinantly and evaluating its acid stability through fluorescence spectroscopy. The data suggest that it remains stable across pH changes. This work thus provides guidance for the characterization of extracellular proteins from extremophilic organisms. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Leptothrix ochracea creates distinctive iron-mineralized mats that carpet streams and wetlands. Easily recognized by its iron-mineralized sheaths, L. ochracea was one of the first microorganisms described in the 1800s. Yet it has never been isolated and does not have a complete genome sequence available, so key questions about its physiology remain unresolved. It is debated whether iron oxidation can be used for energy or growth and if L. ochracea is an autotroph, heterotroph, or mixotroph. To address these issues, we sampled L. ochracea-rich mats from three of its typical environments (a stream, wetlands, and a drainage channel) and reconstructed nine high-quality genomes of L. ochracea from metagenomes. These genomes contain iron oxidase genes cyc2 and mtoA, showing that L. ochracea has the potential to conserve energy from iron oxidation. Sox genes confer potential to oxidize sulfur for energy. There are genes for both carbon fixation (RuBisCO) and utilization of sugars and organic acids (acetate, lactate, and formate). In silico stoichiometric metabolic models further demonstrated the potential for growth using sugars and organic acids. Metatranscriptomes showed a high expression of genes for iron oxidation; aerobic respiration; and utilization of lactate, acetate, and sugars, as well as RuBisCO, supporting mixotrophic growth in the environment. In summary, our results suggest that L. ochracea has substantial metabolic flexibility. It is adapted to iron-rich, organic carbon-containing wetland niches, where it can thrive as a mixotrophic iron oxidizer by utilizing both iron oxidation and organics for energy generation and both inorganic and organic carbon for cell and sheath production.

The packed bed bioreactor (PBBR) was operated under oxygen-limited conditions with different hydraulic retention times (HRT) near-neutral pH. At an HRT of 3 h, removal efficiencies greater than 99 % and 98 % were achieved for S2- bio-oxidation and SO42- bio-reduction, respectively. During the semi-continuous mode of PBBR operation, thiosulfate (S2O32-), a metabolite of sulfur oxidation, was detected in the effluent; however, when the bioreactor was operated in continuous mode at an HRT of 3 h, the concentration of thiosulfate was below the detection limit. The highest S0 selectivity (45 %) was achieved at an HRT of 1 h. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was used to identify the diversity of bacterial species in the biofilm; Thiobacillus sajanensis, Thiobacillus thioparus, and Rhizobium arsenicireducens were found to be the dominant species responsible for the simultaneous biological conversion of sulfide and sulfate. The mechanism of simultaneous sulfide and sulfate bioconversion was investigated and proposed. In summary, the developed PBBR was an efficient method for the concurrent bioconversion of sulfide and sulfate, with considerable selectivity towards elemental sulfur. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance of pathogenic bacteria to currently used antibiotics killed an estimated 1.27 million people in 2019 and it is believed that this toll will increase to 10 million per year by 2050. This remains one of the most urgent threats to human health and the hunt for novel antimicrobial natural products (NPs) from microorganisms is essential in efforts to combat this threat, but recent efforts have been unsuccessful. The investigation of extreme ecological niches, such as hot springs, has gained recent interest due to their unique ecosystems, increasing the chance for novel antimicrobial NP discovery. The Roman Baths (Bath) is the UK's only hot spring and it remains unexplored in terms of microbial diversity. In this study, samples of water, biofilm and sediment were taken from the King's Spring and the Great Bath, and 16 S rRNA metagenomic sequencing was performed for bacterial and archaeal community exploration. Additionally, samples were used for culture-dependent isolation of antimicrobial NP producing isolates. At the phylum level, data from water samples revealed a shift from an archaeal dominant community in the King's Spring (Crenarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota and Nanoarchaeota) to bacteria in the Great Bath (Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria). Archaea were still present in the biofilm and sediment of the hot spring but consistently the bacterial phyla Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria and Nitrospirota were dominant at both sites. The antimicrobial NP producing candidate phyla Actinobacteria and Myxococcota were found in all samples. From initial isolation experiments, 297 isolates were purified, of which 15 showed broad spectrum activity against human pathogens, though interestingly these were not from target genera in the Actinobacteria. From these data, there is clear potential for novel NP discovery from the Roman Baths, as has been demonstrated from other thermal hot springs globally. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Nitrate (NO3−)-reducing Fe(II) oxidation (NRFO) is prevalent in anoxic environments. However, it is uncertain in which step(s) the biological Fe(II) oxidation is coupled with denitrification during NRFO. In this study, a heterotrophic NRFO bacterium, Diaphorobacter caeni LI3T, was isolated from paddy soil and used to investigate the transformation of Fe(II) and nitrogen as well as nitrogen isotopic fractionation (δ15N-N2O) during NRFO. Fe(II) oxidation was observed in the Cell+NO3− +Fe(II), Cell+NO2− + Fe(II), and NO2− + Fe(II) treatments, resulting in precipitation of amorphous Fe(III) minerals and lepidocrocite on the surface and in the periplasm of cells. The presence of Fe(II) slightly accelerated microbial NO3− reduction in the Cell+NO3− + Fe(II) treatment relative to the Cell+NO3− treatment, but slowed down the NO2− reduction in the Cell+NO2− + Fe(II) treatment relative to the Cell+NO2− treatment likely due to cell encrustation that blocking microbial NO2− reduction in the periplasm. The δ15N-N2O results in the Cell+NO3− + Fe(II) treatment were close to those in the Cell+NO3− and Cell+NO2− treatments, indicating that the accumulative N2O is primarily of biological origin during NRFO. The genome analysis found a complete set of denitrification and oxidative phosphorylation genes in strain LI3T, the metabolic pathways of which were closely related with cyc2 and cytc as indicated by protein-protein interactions network analysis. It is proposed that Fe(II) oxidation is catalyzed by the outer membrane protein Cyc2, with the resulting electrons being transferred to the nitrite reductase NirS via CytC in the periplasm, and the CytC can also accept electrons from the oxidative phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic membrane. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the potential pathways of biological Fe(II) oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction in heterotrophic NRFO bacteria. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {As focus for exploration of Mars transitions from current robotic explorers to development of crewed missions, it remains important to protect the integrity of scientific investigations at Mars, as well as protect the Earth's biosphere from any potential harmful effects from returned martian material. This is the discipline of planetary protection, and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) maintains the consensus international policy and guidelines on how this is implemented. Based on National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency (ESA) studies that began in 2001, COSPAR adopted principles and guidelines for human missions to Mars in 2008. At that point, it was clear that to move from those qualitative provisions, a great deal of work and interaction with spacecraft designers would be necessary to generate meaningful quantitative recommendations that could embody the intent of the Outer Space Treaty (Article IX) in the design of such missions. Beginning in 2016, COSPAR then sponsored a multiyear interdisciplinary meeting series to address planetary protection “knowledge gaps” (KGs) with the intent of adapting and extending the current robotic mission-focused Planetary Protection Policy to support the design and implementation of crewed and hybrid exploration missions. This article describes the outcome of the interdisciplinary COSPAR meeting series, to describe and address these KGs, as well as identify potential paths to gap closure. It includes the background scientific basis for each topic area and knowledge updates since the meeting series ended. In particular, credible solutions for KG closure are described for the three topic areas of (1) microbial monitoring of spacecraft and crew health; (2) natural transport (and survival) of terrestrial microbial contamination at Mars, and (3) the technology and operation of spacecraft systems for contamination control. The article includes a KG data table on these topic areas, which is intended to be a point of departure for making future progress in developing an end-to-end planetary protection requirements implementation solution for a crewed mission to Mars. Overall, the workshop series has provided evidence of the feasibility of planetary protection implementation for a crewed Mars mission, given (1) the establishment of needed zoning, emission, transport, and survival parameters for terrestrial biological contamination and (2) the creation of an accepted risk-based compliance approach for adoption by spacefaring actors including national space agencies and commercial/nongovernment organizations.

While advances in artificial intelligence revealed the tertiary structure of proteins at scale, their quaternary structure remains mostly unknown. We devise a scalable strategy based on AlphaFold2 to predict homo-oligomeric assemblies across four proteomes spanning the tree of life. Our results suggest that approximately 45% of an archaeal proteome and a bacterial proteome and 20% of two eukaryotic proteomes form homomers. Our predictions accurately capture protein homo-oligomerization, recapitulate megadalton complexes, and unveil hundreds of homo-oligomer types, including three confirmed experimentally by structure determination. Integrating these datasets with omics information suggests that a majority of known protein complexes are symmetric. Finally, these datasets provide a structural context for interpreting disease mutations and reveal coiled-coil regions as major enablers of quaternary structure evolution in human. Our strategy is applicable to any organism and provides a comprehensive view of homo-oligomerization in proteomes. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance (AMR) in animal agriculture represents a critical One Health challenge, with pig farms serving as major reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). While MGEs are known drivers of ARG dissemination, their impact on actual expression of resistance in these complex microbial communities is poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify the contribution of MGE-associated ARGs to overall resistance expression and compare their transcriptional efficiency to chromosomally located ARGs in pig farm wastewater. Utilizing deep metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on wastewater from five typical Chinese pig farms, we comprehensively elucidated ARG presence, genetic context, host association, and transcriptional activity. We identified a vast dataset comprising 811 ARG types conferring resistance to 27 antibiotic classes, with 71.02 % actively transcribed, indicating significant resistance potential. MGEs were associated with 34.87 % of ARG-like ORFs. Crucially, MGE-associated ARGs were responsible for the majority (62.07 %) of total ARG transcript abundance, exhibiting an expression efficiency nearly 2.5 times higher than ARGs on chromosomal non-MGE loci. Taxonomic analysis revealed that these highly expressed MGE-associated ARGs were primarily hosted by genera known to include opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Klebsiella. Differential coverage binning further uncovered diverse draft genomes simultaneously harboring multiple highly expressed ARGs and MGEs, potentially contributing to the persistence and spread of highly resistant bacterial strains. Our findings underscore that MGEs not only propagate ARGs but critically enhance their expression, providing vital data for effective AMR surveillance and mitigation strategies within the One Health framework. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Many organisms have adapted to survive in environments with high levels of arsenic (As), a naturally occurring metalloid with various oxidation states and a common element in human activities. These organisms employ diverse mechanisms to resist the harmful effects of arsenic compounds. Ten arsenic-resistant bacteria were isolated from contaminated wastewater in this study. The most efficient bacterial isolate able to resist 15,000 ppm Na2HAsO4·7H2O was identified using the 16S rRNA gene and whole genome analysis as Enterobacter cloacae FACU. The arsenic E. cloacae FACU biosorption capability was analyzed. To further unravel the genetic determinants of As stress resistance, the whole genome sequence of E. cloacae FACU was performed. The FACU complete genome sequence consists of one chromosome (5.7 Mb) and two plasmids, pENCL 1 and pENCL 2 (755,058 and 1155666 bp, respectively). 7152 CDSs were identified in the E. cloacae FACU genome. The genome consists of 130 genes for tRNA and 21 for rRNAs. The average G + C content was found to be 54%. Sequencing analysis annotated 58 genes related to resistance to many heavy metals, including 16 genes involved in arsenic efflux transporter and arsenic reduction (five arsRDABC genes) and 42 genes related to lead, zinc, mercury, nickel, silver, copper, cadmium and chromium in FACU. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the difference between the morphological responses of the As-treated FACU compared to the control strain. The study highlights the genes involved in the mechanism of As stress resistance, metabolic pathways, and potential activity of E. cloacae FACU at the genetic level. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {A thermophilic cellulase-producing bacterium, strain HSW-8T, isolated from hot spring waters in South Korea, was subjected to a taxonomic analysis. Cells of strain HSW-8T were gram-stain-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, with optimum growth at 45 °C, pH 7.0, in the presence of 0% (w/v) NaCl. Strain HSW-8T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Sinimarinibacterium flocculans NH6-24T (97.52%), followed by Fontimonas thermophila DSM 23609T (96.97%), Solimonas flava CW-KD 4T (95.24%), and Solimonas variicoloris DSM 15731T (95.18%). Based on 16S rRNA phylogeny, strain HSW-8T is phylogenetically closely related to Fontimonas thermophila DSM 23609T and Sinimarinibacterium flocculans DSM 104150T and could be distinguished from the type species based on their phenotypic properties. The genome length of strain HSW-8T was 3.32 Mbp with a 67.33% G + C content. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values between strain HSW-8T and its closely related type strains were 75.4–83.2 and 20.2–26.2%, respectively. Summed feature 8 (C18:1ω7c and/or C18:1ω6c), C16:0, and iso-C16:0 identified the major fatty acids (> 10%). Phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine were demonstrated as the major polar lipids while the respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8. Strain HSW-8T exhibited multiple adaptations for survival at high temperatures, including diverse potential motility mechanisms and toxin-antitoxin systems, as evidenced by both phenotypic characteristics and genomic analysis. Based on genotypic and phenotypic features, strain HSW-8T (= KCTC 92765T = GDMCC 1.4313T) represents a novel Sinimarinibacterium species, in which the name Sinimarinibacterium thermocellulolyticum sp. nov. is proposed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) represents an energy-efficient process for the removal of biological nitrogen from ammonium-rich wastewater. However, the susceptibility of anammox bacteria to coexisting heavy metals considerably restricts their use in engineering practices. Here, we report that acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), a signaling molecule that mediates quorum sensing (QS), significantly enhances the nitrogen removal rate by 24% under Cu2+ stress. A suite of macro-/microanalytical and bioinformatic analyses was exploited to unravel the underlying mechanisms of AHL-induced Cu2+ resistance. Macro-/microanalytical evidence indicated that AHL regulations on the production, spatial distribution, and functional groups of extracellular polymeric substances were not significant, ruling out extracellular partitioning and complexation as a principal mechanism. Meanwhile, molecular biological evidence showed that AHL upregulated the transcriptional levels of resistance genes (sod, kat, cysQ, and czcC responsible for antioxidation defense, Cu2+ sequestration, and transport) to appreciable extents, indicating intracellular resistance as the primary mechanism. This study yielded a mechanistic understanding of the regulatory roles of AHL in extracellular and intracellular resistance of anammox consortia, providing a fundamental basis for utilizing QS regulation for efficient nitrogen removal in wastewaters with heavy metal stress. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

We observe Hyphomicrobium spp. as part of a Fe2+/Mn2+-oxidizing consortia native to the ferruginous bottom waters of a Ln3+-enriched lake in Czechia. Notably, one species shows similarities to recently discovered bacteria expressing proteins with picomolar Ln3+ affinity. This finding was substantiated by developing an in-silico ionic competition model and recombinant expression of a homolog protein (Hm-LanM) from Hyphomicrobium methylovorum. Biochemical assays validate Hm-LanM preference for lighter Ln3+ ions (from lanthanum to gadolinium). This is comparable to established prototypes. Bioinformatics analyses further uncover additional H. methylovorum metabolic biomolecules in genomic proximity to Hm-LanM analogously dependent on Ln3+, including an outer membrane receptor that binds Ln3+-chelating siderophores. These combined observations underscore the remarkable strategy of Hyphomicrobium spp. for thriving in relatively Ln3+ enriched zones of metal-polluted environments. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The diversity of phage-related sequences (PRSs) and their site-specific integration into the genomes of nonpathogenic, agriculturally valuable, nitrogen-fixing root nodule bacteria, such as Sinorhizobium meliloti, were evaluated in this study. A total of 314 PRSs, ranging in size from 3.24 kb to 88.98 kb, were identified in the genomes of 27 S. meliloti strains. The amount of genetic information foreign to S. meliloti accumulated in all identified PRSs was 6.30 Mb. However, more than 53% of this information was contained in prophages (Phs) and genomic islands (GIs) integrated into genes encoding tRNAs (tRNA genes) located on the chromosomes of the rhizobial strains studied. It was found that phiLM21-like Phs were predominantly abundant in the genomes of S. meliloti strains of distant geographical origin, whereas RR1-A- and 16-3-like Phs were much less common. In addition, GIs predominantly contained fragments of phages infecting bacteria of distant taxa, while rhizobiophage-like sequences were unique. A site-specific integration analysis revealed that not all tRNA genes in S. meliloti are integration sites, but among those in which integration occurred, there were “hot spots” of integration into which either Phs or GIs were predominantly inserted. For the first time, it is shown that at these integration “hot spots”, not only is the homology of attP and attB strictly preserved, but integrases in PRSs similar to those of phages infecting the Proteobacteria genera Azospirillum or Pseudomonas are also present. The data presented greatly expand the understanding of the fate of phage-related sequences in host bacterial genomes and also raise new questions about the role of phages in bacterial–phage coevolution. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Corynebacterium glutamicum is a non-pathogenic species of the Corynebacteriaceae family. It has been broadly used in industrial biotechnology for the production of valuable products. Though it is widely accepted at the industrial level, knowledge about the genomic diversity of the strains is limited. Here, we investigated the comparative genomic features of the strains and pan-genomic characteristics. We also observed phylogenetic relationships among the strains based on average nucleotide identity (ANI). We found diversity between strains at the genomic and pan-genomic levels. Less than one-third of the C. glutamicum pan-genome consists of core genes and soft-core genes. Whereas, a large number of strain-specific genes covered about half of the total pan-genome. Besides, C. glutamicum pan-genome is open and expanding, which indicates the possible addition of new gene families to the pan-genome. We also investigated the distribution of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) among the strains. We discovered slight variations of BGCs at the strain level. Several BGCs with the potential to express novel bioactive secondary metabolites have been identified. Therefore, by utilizing the characteristic advantages of C. glutamicum, different strains can be potential applicants for natural drug discovery. Copyright: © 2024 Rahman et al.},

	abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) significantly threaten the ecosystem and public health. Biodegradation has emerged as a promising technology for removing MCs. Many MCs-degrading bacteria have been identified, including an indigenous bacterium Sphingopyxis sp. YF1 that could degrade MC-LR and Adda completely. Herein, we gained insight into the MCs biodegradation mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of MCs-degrading bacteria, and revealed the toxic risks of the MCs degradation products. The biochemical characteristics and genetic repertoires of strain YF1 were explored. A comparative genomic analysis was performed on strain YF1 and six other MCs-degrading bacteria to investigate their functions. The degradation products were investigated, and the toxicity of the intermediates was analyzed through rigorous theoretical calculation. Strain YF1 might be a novel species that exhibited versatile substrate utilization capabilities. Many common genes and metabolic pathways were identified, shedding light on shared functions and catabolism in the MCs-degrading bacteria. The crucial genes involved in MCs catabolism mechanisms, including mlr and paa gene clusters, were identified successfully. These functional genes might experience horizontal gene transfer events, suggesting the evolutionary dynamics of these MCs-degrading bacteria in ecology. Moreover, the degradation products for MCs and Adda were summarized, and we found most of the intermediates exhibited lower toxicity to different organisms than the parent compound. These findings systematically revealed the MCs catabolism mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of MCs-degrading bacteria.

	abstract = {Allopatric speciation has been difficult to examine among microorganisms, with prior reports of endemism restricted to sub-genus level taxa. Previous microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 925 geothermal springs from the Taupō Volcanic Zone (TVZ), Aotearoa-New Zealand, revealed widespread distribution and abundance of a single bacterial genus across 686 of these ecosystems (pH 1.2-9.6 and 17.4-99.8 °C). Here, we present evidence to suggest that this genus, Venenivibrio (phylum Aquificota), is endemic to Aotearoa-New Zealand. A specific environmental niche that increases habitat isolation was identified, with maximal read abundance of Venenivibrio occurring at pH 4-6, 50-70 °C, and low oxidation-reduction potentials. This was further highlighted by genomic and culture-based analyses of the only characterised species for the genus, Venenivibrio stagnispumantis CP.B2T, which confirmed a chemolithoautotrophic metabolism dependent on hydrogen oxidation. While similarity between Venenivibrio populations illustrated that dispersal is not limited across the TVZ, extensive amplicon, metagenomic, and phylogenomic analyses of global microbial communities from DNA sequence databases indicates Venenivibrio is geographically restricted to the Aotearoa-New Zealand archipelago. We conclude that geographic isolation, complemented by physicochemical constraints, has resulted in the establishment of an endemic bacterial genus. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Hot spring environments encompass broad physicochemical ranges, in which temperature and pH account for crucial factors shaping hot spring microbial community and diversity. However, the presence of photosynthetic microbial mats adjacent to boiling hot spring vents, where fluid temperatures extend beyond photosynthetic capability, questions the microbial profiles and the actual temperatures of such adjacent mats. Therefore, this study aims to characterize thermophilic microbial communities at Pong Dueat Pa Pae hot spring using next-generation sequencing, including investigating hot spring mineralogy. Results suggest that Pong Dueat Pa Pae hot spring precipitates comprise mainly silica which also acts as the main preservative medium for microbial permineralization. Molecular results revealed the presence of cyanobacterial and Chloroflexi species in the thick, orange and green subaerial mats surrounding the vents, suggesting the mats would be at least 30 °C cooler than source vents despite constantly receiving geyser splashes. Bacterial abundance was considerably higher than archaeal (97.9% versus 2.1%). Cyanobacterial (mainly Synechococcus and Leptolygbya) and Chloroflexi species (mainly Roseiflexus) accounted for almost half (40.04%) of the bacterial community, while DHVEG-6 and Thaumarchaeota comprised dominant members (> 90%) of the archaeal fraction.

	abstract = {The rapid industrial revolution significantly increased heavy metal pollution, becoming a major global environmental concern. This pollution is considered as one of the most harmful and toxic threats to all environmental components (air, soil, water, animals, and plants until reaching to human). Therefore, scientists try to find a promising and eco-friendly technique to solve this problem i.e., bacterial bioremediation. Various heavy metal resistance mechanisms were reported. Omics technologies can significantly improve our understanding of heavy metal resistant bacteria and their communities. They are a potent tool for investigating the adaptation processes of microbes in severe conditions. These omics methods provide unique benefits for investigating metabolic alterations, microbial diversity, and mechanisms of resistance of individual strains or communities to harsh conditions. Starting with genome sequencing which provides us with complete and comprehensive insight into the resistance mechanism of heavy metal resistant bacteria. Moreover, genome sequencing facilitates the opportunities to identify specific metal resistance genes, operons, and regulatory elements in the genomes of individual bacteria, understand the genetic mechanisms and variations responsible for heavy metal resistance within and between bacterial species in addition to the transcriptome, proteome that obtain the real expressed genes. Moreover, at the community level, metagenome, meta transcriptome and meta proteome participate in understanding the microbial interactive network potentially novel metabolic pathways, enzymes and gene species can all be found using these methods.

	abstract = {Nitrate/nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO) process offers a promising solution for simultaneously achieving methane emissions reduction and efficient nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment. Although nitrogen removal at a practical rate has been achieved by n-DAMO biofilm process, the mechanisms of biofilm formation and nitrogen transformation remain to be elucidated. In this study, n-DAMO biofilms were successfully developed in the membrane aerated moving bed biofilm reactor (MAMBBR) and removed nitrate at a rate of 159 mg NO3−-N L−1 d−1. The obvious increase in the content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) indicated that EPS production was important for biofilm development. n-DAMO microorganisms dominated the microbial community, and n-DAMO bacteria were the most abundant microorganisms. However, the expression of biosynthesis genes for proteins and polysaccharides encoded by n-DAMO archaea was significantly more active compared to other microorganisms, suggesting the central role of n-DAMO archaea in EPS production and biofilm formation. In addition to nitrate reduction, n-DAMO archaea were revealed to actively express dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and nitrogen fixation. The produced ammonium was putatively converted to dinitrogen gas through the joint function of n-DAMO archaea and n-DAMO bacteria. This study revealed the biofilm formation mechanism and nitrogen-transformation network in n-DAMO biofilm systems, shedding new light on promoting the application of n-DAMO process. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Microbial scale-up cultivation is the first step to bioremediating cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soils at the industrial scale. However, the changes in the microbial community as the bioreactor volume expands and their associations with soil Cd removal remain unclear. Herein, a six-stage scale-up cultivation process of mixotrophic acidophiles was conducted, scaling from 0.1 L to 10 m3, to remediate Cd-contaminated soils. The findings showed that bioreactor expansion led to a delay in sulfur and glucose oxidations, resulting in a reduced decline in solution pH and cell density. There were minimal differences observed in bacterial alpha-diversity and community structure as the bioreactor volume increased, except for the 10 m3 scale. However, bioreactor expansion decreased fungal alpha-diversity, changed the community structure, and simplified fungal community compositions. At the family level, Acidithiobacillaceae and Debaryomycetaceae dominated the bacterial and fungal communities throughout the scale-up process, respectively. Correlation analysis indicated that the indirect effect of mixotrophic acidophiles played a significant role in soil Cd removal. Bacterial community shifts, driven by changes in bioreactor volume, decreased the pH value through sulfur oxidation, thereby indirectly enhancing Cd removal efficiency. This study will contribute to the potential industrial application of mixotrophic acidophiles in bioremediating Cd-contaminated soils. © 2024 by the authors.},

The membrane protein encoded by Mtb Rv0102, when its homolog in M. smegmatis (MSMEG_4702) was knocked out, resulted in a fourfold decrease in intracellular copper levels and enhanced tolerance to elevated extracellular copper concentrations. Similarly, knockout mutants of its homolog in M. marinum (MMAR_0267) showed increased virulence in zebrafish and higher bacterial load within macrophages. In THP-1 cells infected with MMAR_0267 deletion mutants, the intracellular survival of these mutants increased, along with reduced THP-1 cell apoptosis. Deficiency in copper down-regulated the transcriptional level of the virulence factor CFP-10 in M. marinum, suppressed cytosolic signaling via the macrophage STING pathway, leading to decreased production of IFN-β and reduced cell apoptosis. In conclusion, these findings highlight the significant impact of copper on the survival and reproduction of mycobacteria, underscoring the importance of studying mycobacterial adaptation mechanisms in copper-rich environments. © The Author(s) 2024.},

However, the ecological adaptability of microbes to harsh reservoirs, such as low-permeability, high-salinity, and anoxic conditions, limits oil production and the mechanism of enhancing oil recovery remains uncertain. In this study, we demonstrated that native Bacillus velezensis B6 can adapt to the geological environment of at least three oilfields and significantly improve oil production. Specifically, a total of 62 well-times were conducted in the Yingdong Oilfield, Huatugou Oilfield, and Yuejin Oilfield, which have low to medium permeability (30–89 × 10−3 µm2), high salinity (mineralization degree of 147,258–205,973 mg/L), resin and asphaltene content of 8 %～20 %, and wax content of 12 %～28 %, with a cumulative oil increase of 4573.82 m3 in 270 days and an overall input–output ratio of 1:6.6. Moreover, analyses of the genome, transcriptome, microbiome, functional traits, and pre- and post-operation oil properties revealed the environmental adaptability and oil recovery mechanism of B6. The MEOR mode of multimechanism collaboration was revealed through reducing surface tension, emulsification, gas production, petroleum degradation, reconstructing metabolic pathways, and adjusting reservoir microbial community structure.

	abstract = {Groundwater offers an intriguing blend of distinctive physical and chemical conditions, constituting a challenge for microbial life. In Mallorca, the largest island of Balearic archipelago, harbours a variety of thermal anomalies (i.e., geothermal manifestation where surface aquifers exhibiting temperatures exceeding the regional average). The metagenomes of two aquifers in the centre and southern of the island showed Pseudomonadota to be the most represented phylum when using extracted 16S rRNA gene sequences. However, the microbial structures within and between aquifers were remarkably diverse but similar in their metabolic profiles as revealed by the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) pointing to a prevalence of aerobic chemolithoautotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms, especially in the Llucmajor aquifer. Also, some evidences of anaerobic lifestyles were detected, which would indicate that these environments either could suffer episodes of oxygen depletion or the anaerobes had been transported from deeper waters. We believe that the local environmental factors (temperature, external inputs or chemistry) seem to be more relevant than the connection and, eventually, transport of microbial cells within the aquifer in determining the highly divergent structures. Notably, most of the reconstructed genomes belonged to undescribed bacterial lineages and from them two high-quality MAGs could be classified as novel taxa named following the rules of the Code for Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Described from Sequence Data (SeqCode). Accordingly, we propose the new species and genus Costitxia debesea gen. nov., sp. nov., affiliated with the novel family Costitxiaceae fam. nov., order Costitxiales ord. nov. and class Costitxiia class. nov.; and the new new species and genus Lloretia debesea gen. nov. sp. nov. affiliated with the novel family Lloretiaceae fam. nov. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Cable bacteria, filamentoussulfideoxidizers that live in sulfidicsediments, are at times associated with large flocksof swimming bacteria. It has been proposed that these flocksof bacteria transport electrons extracellularly to cable bacteria via an electron shuttle intermediate, but the identity and activity of these bacteria in freshwater sediment remain mostly uninvestigated. Here, we elucidate the electron exchange capabilities of the bacterial community by coupling metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to 16S rRNA amplicon-based correlations with cable bacteria over 155 days. We identifiedcandidate flockingbacteria as bacteria containing genes for motility and extracellular electron transfer including synthesis genes for potential extracellular electron shuttles: phenazines and flavins.Based on these criteria, 22 MAGs were from candidate flockers,which constituted 21.4% of all 103 MAGs. Of the candidate flockingbacteria, 42.1% expressed extracellular electron transfer genes. The proposed flockersbelonged to a large variety of metabolically versatile taxonomic groups: 18 genera spread across nine phyla. Our data suggest that cable bacteria in freshwater sediments engage in electric relationships with diverse exoelectrogenic microbes. This community, found in deeper anoxic sediment layers, is involved in sulfur, carbon, and metal (in particular Fe) cycling and indirectly utilizes oxygen here by extracellularly transferring electrons to cable bacteria.  © 2024 Lustermans et al.

	abstract = {Heap bioleaching is considered to be a less energy-intensive metal-extraction technique compared to other methods, making it particularly attractive for low-grade sulfide ores. It has been successfully applied to recovery of copper, gold, and uranium from ores over decades. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, heap bioleaching can experience failures if the ore is unsuitable or the heap leach process is not thoroughly investigated and well-developed. Therefore, multidisciplinary approaches are essential for research and development in heap bioleaching, as its performance depends on numerous processes operating across a wide range of length scales. This review focused on the current state of knowledge regarding the understanding of multi-scale mechanisms in heap bioleaching and the use of multidisciplinary approaches at different scales to develop the process. The investigation covered various scales, such as atomic and molecular, mineralogy and microbes, reaction particles, heap bioleaching units and full-scale factory production. Different approaches were employed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the microbial molecular structure and metabolism, the structure and reaction of minerals, microbial–mineral interaction, particles and aggregation states, and multiphase flow transfer, as well as laboratory experiments, modeling, industrialization, and operation optimization. We emphasized the need for collaboration among researchers from different disciplines and stress the importance of considering the coupling effects of physical, chemical, and microbiological factors when running heap bioleaching plants. Such collaboration and coupling are vital for successful implementation and optimization of heap bioleaching processes. This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of current research related to heap bioleaching at different scales and disciplines, and gave implications to heap bioleaching technology development. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are important but often overlooked regulators of uranium (U) cycling in soil. However, the impact of PSB on uranate fixation coupled with the decomposition of recalcitrant phosphorus (P) in mining land remains poorly understood. Here, we combined gene amplicon sequencing, metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing analysis and strain isolation to explore the effects of PSB on the stabilization of uranate and P availability in U mining areas. We found that the content of available phosphorus (AP), carbonate-U and Fe-Mn-U oxides in tailings was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than their adjacent soils. Also, organic phosphate mineralizing (PhoD) bacteria (e.g., Streptomyces) and inorganic phosphate solubilizing (gcd) bacteria (e.g., Rhodococcus) were enriched in tailings and soils, but only organic phosphate mineralizing-bacteria substantially contributed to the AP. Notably, most genes involved in organophosphorus mineralization and uranate resistance were widely present in tailings rather than soil. Comparative genomics analyses supported that organophosphorus mineralizing-Streptomyces species could increase soil AP content and immobilize U(VI) through organophosphorus mineralization (e.g., PhoD, ugpBAEC) and U resistance related genes (e.g., petA). We further demonstrated that the isolated Streptomyces sp. PSBY1 could enhance the U(VI) immobilization mediated by the NADH-dependent ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (petA) through decomposing organophosphorous compounds. This study advances our understanding of the roles of PSB in regulating the fixation of uranate and P availability in U tailings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The high biotoxicity of selenium (Se) has spurred research into its microbial biotransformation into less toxic Se nanoparticles (SeNPs). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying microbially driven selenite transformation remain largely unknown. In the present study, Acinetobacter sp. SX5, a bacterial strain with high Se reduction capacity, was isolated from soil. The biotransformation of selenite by SX5 and the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of SeNPs were investigated. SX5 almost completely transformed 5.0 mM selenite into intracellular and extracellular spherical SeNPs within 48 h. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates were present on the surface of these SeNPs. Transcriptomic data subsequently revealed the significant upregulation of genes related to redox homeostasis and arsenate, pyruvate, and butanoate metabolism pathways. Gene mutation/complementation analysis confirmed that arsenate reductase (arsC) and NAD(P)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (dhaT1) facilitated selenite reduction in vivo. In vitro assays found that arsC and dhaT1 catalyzed Se(IV) reduction with NADPH acting as co-factor. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to present evidence for the participation of arsC and dhaT1 in selenite reduction in vivo, providing important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the biotransformation of Se(IV) and the biogenesis of SeNPs using Se-reducing bacteria. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In marine environments, a wide variety of microbes like bacteria, and archaea influence on the corrosion of materials. Viruses are widely distributed in biofilms among these microbes and may affect the corrosion process through interactions with key corrosive prokaryotes. However, understanding of the viral communities within biofilms and their interactions with corrosive microbes remains is limited. To improve this knowledge gap, 53 metagenomes were utilized to investigate the diversity of viruses within biofilms on 8 different materials and their interactions with corrosive microbes. Notably, the viruses within biofilms predominantly belonged to Caudoviricetes, and phylogenetic analysis of Caudoviricetes and protein-sharing networks with other environments revealed the presence of numerous novel viral clades in biofilms. The virus‒host linkages revealed a close association between viruses and corrosive microbes in biofilms. This means that viruses may modulate host corrosion-related metabolism through auxiliary metabolic genes. It was observed that the virus could enhance host resistance to metals and antibiotics via horizontal gene transfer. Interestingly, viruses could protect themselves from host antiviral systems through anti-defense systems. This study illustrates the diversity of viruses within biofilms formed on materials and the intricate interactions between viruses and corrosive microbes, showing the potential roles of viruses in corrosive biofilms. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The family Hapalosiphonaceae is grouped under subsection IV complying with International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). This is a complex taxonomic group with often overlapping morphological traits. The members of this group have heterogeneous habitats and need urgent attention for de-entangling the taxon. The genome comparisons among 44 high quality drafts belonging to Hapalosiphonaceae suggests the presence of three distinct groups, one largely dominated by thermophiles (Group 1) and the other comprising of members of diverse habitats (Group 2). The third group is small with only 2 representative members (Group 3) are considered as outliers. The group containing members of diverse habitats are characterized by the presence of higher number of ORFan genes, mobilome and secondary metabolites genes. The thermophiles belonging to Group 1 are characterized by compact genome whereas the Group 2 genomes having diverse ecological habitat show genome expansion possibly due to recent acquisition. Comparison of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution of conserved genes suggest, members of Group 2 are undergoing relaxed purifying selection. There is a significant increase in the number of core genes (2075 for n = 35) when Group 1 organisms are considered alone compared to only 46 core genes when all three groups are taken together (n = 44). The presence of a huge pan genome (47,756) and a relatively tiny core genome (46) suggests that the taxon is an open and expanding. Members of Group 2 are distinct in coding for commercial metabolite shinorine that was visibly absent from other members of the Hapalosiphonaceae.

	abstract = {Cladonia borealis is a lichen that inhabits Antarctica’s harsh environment. We sequenced the whole genome of a C. borealis culture isolated from a specimen collected in Antarctica using long-read sequencing technology to identify specific genetic elements related to its potential environmental adaptation. The final genome assembly produced 48 scaffolds, the longest being 2.2 Mbp, a 1.6 Mbp N50 contig length, and a 36 Mbp total length. A total of 10,749 protein-coding genes were annotated, containing 33 biosynthetic gene clusters and 102 carbohydrate-active enzymes. A comparative genomics analysis was conducted on six Cladonia species, and the genome of C. borealis exhibited 45 expanded and 50 contracted gene families. We identified that C. borealis has more Copia transposable elements and expanded transporters (ABC transporters and magnesium transporters) compared to other Cladonia species. Our results suggest that these differences contribute to C. borealis’ remarkable adaptability in the Antarctic environment. This study also provides a useful resource for the genomic analysis of lichens and genetic insights into the survival of species isolated from Antarctica. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become a widely adopted energy source for various electrical devices, ranging from small devices to large machines, such as cell phones, and electric vehicles (EVs). The increasing number of EVs, and other electrical devices has led to the enormous amount of discarded spent LIBs into the landfill. The amount of LIB waste generated in 2019 alone from EVs was 500,000 tons. This amount is expected to reach 8,000,000 tons by 2040. Globally, only 5 % of discarded spent LIBs is presently being recycled. The need to recycle LIBs stems from the desire to conserve raw materials, and save cost. Also, LIBs comprise heavy metals (Ni, Li, Co, Cu, Mn, Fe, and Al), and hazardous chemicals, which cause serious environmental hazards and threaten human lives; thus, pointing out the need to recycle LIBs. This work reviewed different recycling techniques and, the latest technological advancements in pretreatment methods, hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, and direct recycling methods.

Twenty-five drugresistant strains were obtained by mutagenesis. The 16S rRNA in five mutant strains had a point mutation (A257C) or a gene deletion in C1, V1, V2, V6−V9, and C6−C9 regions, respectively.

	abstract = {Virulence is an organism’s ability to infect the host and cause disease, and this ability is determined by the presence of virulence factors. The “do not kill, neutralize” strategy used by antivirulence therapies is a novel approach to managing the increasing drug resistance. In this respect, type IV pilus is one druggable target among many virulence factors. The type IV pili (T4P) assembly systems with adaptable and flexible filaments are utilized by numerous pathogens for infection. The current work focuses on druggable targets of T4aP with specific emphasis on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Additionally, available information on potential inhibitor molecules that attenuate T4P activities or impair pilus function and/or assembly in different pathogens is summarized. The structural organization of T4aP suggests that ATPases, pilins, tip-associated adhesins, and peptidases could be considered potential target sites. As the number of high-resolution structures of different T4P systems and the computational power to model T4P machineries increase, the pace in the identification of novel molecules and targets to attenuate the activities of T4P will accelerate. Artificial intelligence, which has already penetrated into our daily lives, will definitely have a prominent role in providing a framework for progress in this area.

	abstract = {Motivated by the ambition to establish an enzyme-driven bioleaching pathway for copper extraction, properties of the Type-1 copper protein rusticyanin from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (AfR) were compared with those from an ancestral form of this enzyme (N0) and an archaeal enzyme identified in Ferroplasma acidiphilum (FaR). While both N0 and FaR show redox potentials similar to that of AfR their electron transport rates were significantly slower. The lack of a correlation between the redox potentials and electron transfer rates indicates that AfR and its associated electron transfer chain evolved to specifically facilitate the efficient conversion of the energy of iron oxidation to ATP formation. In F. acidiphilum this pathway is not as efficient unless it is up-regulated by an as of yet unknown mechanism. In addition, while the electrochemical properties of AfR were consistent with previous data, previously unreported behavior was found leading to a form that is associated with a partially unfolded form of the protein. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) response of AfR immobilized onto an electrode showed limited stability, which may be connected to the presence of the partially unfolded state of this protein. Insights gained in this study may thus inform the engineering of optimized rusticyanin variants for bioleaching processes as well as enzyme-catalyzed solubilization of copper-containing ores such as chalcopyrite. © 2023},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid that causes severe environmental contamination worldwide. Upon exposure to aqueous phases, the As-bearing minerals, such as orpiment (As2S3) and realgar (As4S4), undergo oxidative dissolution, in which biotic and abiotic activities both contributed significant roles. Consequently, the dissolved As and S are rapidly discharged through water transportation to broader regions and contaminate surrounding areas, especially in aquatic environments. Despite both orpiment and realgar are frequently encountered in carbonate-hosted neutral environments, the microbial-mediated oxidative dissolution of these minerals, however, have been primarily investigated under acidic conditions. Therefore, the current study aimed to elucidate microbial-mediated oxidative dissolution under neutral aquatic conditions. The current study demonstrated that the dissolution of orpiment and realgar is synergistically regulated by abiotic (i.e., specific surface area (SSA) of the mineral) and biotic (i.e., microbial oxidation) factors. The initial dissolution of As(III) and S2− from minerals is abiotically impacted by SSA, while the microbial oxidation of As(III) and S2− accelerated the overall dissolution rates of orpiment and realgar. In As-contaminated environments, members of Thiobacillus and Rhizobium were identified as the major populations that mediated oxidative dissolution of orpiment and realgar by DNA-stable isotope probing. This study provides novel insights regarding the microbial-mediated oxidative dissolution process of orpiment and realgar under neutral conditions. © 2024},

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems serve as crucial reservoirs for pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes, thus presenting a significantglobal health risk. Here, we investigated the phylogenomics of Aeromonas veronii from Lake Wilcox in Ontario. Among the 11 bacterial isolates, nine were identifiedas A. veronii. Notably, 67% of A. veronii isolates were potential human pathogens. Considerable genetic diversity was noted among the A. veronii isolates, suggesting the lake as a reservoir for multiple human pathogenic strains. Comparison of the A. veronii sequenced with global A. veronii genomes highlighted significantgenetic diversity and suggests widespread dissemination of strains. All the isolates carried chromosomal genes encoding resistance to β-lactams. Although virulence gene content differedbetween human and non-human pathogenic strains, type III secretion systems was associated with human pathogenic isolates. The assessment of AMR genes in global isolates showed that β-lactam and tetracycline resistance genes were predominant. Although the machine learning-based pangenome-wide association approach performed did not yield any source-based genes, some genes were enriched in a few isolates from differentsources. The mrkABCDF operon that mediates biofilmformation and genes encoding resistance to colistin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and tetracycline were enriched in animal products, whereas macrolide resistance genes and Inc plasmid-types were linked to the aquatic environment. Novel biosynthetic gene clusters were identified,suggesting that A. veronii with varying pathogenic potential could produce unique secondary metabolites. There is a need for continuous tracking of pathogens in aquatic ecosystems to contribute to our understanding of their evolutionary dynamics and the ecological roles of their genetic elements. © 2024 Lawal et al.},

	abstract = {Puga geothermal geyser and surrounding area, located in the Himalayan Geothermal Belt of the Trans-Himalayan Plateau in Ladakh, India, are very geographically isolated and considered pristine and free of anthropogenic activities. In this study, we have conducted the first metagenomic investigation of the microbes in and around the geyser. The whole genome sequencing analysis showed the presence of a total of 44.8%, 39.7% and 41.4% bacterial phyla in the PugW, PugS, and PugSo samples respectively, 8.6% of archaeal phyla (in all the samples), unclassified (derived from other sequences, PugW: 27.6%, PugS: 27.6%, and PugSo: 15.5%) and unclassified (derived from bacteria, PugW: 12%, PugS: 13.8%, and PugSo: 13.8%). The majority of archaeal sequences were linked to Euryarchaeota (2.84%) while the majority of the bacterial communities that predominated in most geothermal locations were linked to Pseudomonadota (67.14%) and Bacteroidota (12.52%). The abundant bacterial strains at the species level included Dechloromonas aromatica, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Arcobacter butzleri, in all the samples while the most abundant archaeal species were Methanosaeta thermophile, Methanoregula boonei, and Methanosarcina berkeri. Further, this geothermal geyser metagenome has a large number of unique sequences linked to unidentified and unclassified lineages, suggesting a potential source for novel species of microbes and their products. The present study which only examined one of the many geothermal geysers and springs in the Puga geothermal area, should be regarded as a preliminary investigation of the microbiota that live in the geothermal springs on these remote areas. These findings suggest that further investigations should be undertaken to characterize the ecosystems of the Puga geothermal area, which serve as a repository for unidentified microbial lineages. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

	abstract = {Conserved Histidine Alpha-helical Domain (CHAD) proteins attached to the surface of polyphosphate (PolyP) have been studied in some bacteria and one archaeon. However, the activity of CHAD proteins is unknown beyond their interaction with PolyP granules. By using bioinformatic analysis, we report that several species of the biomining acidophilic bacteria contain orthologs of CHAD proteins with high sequence identity. Furthermore, the gene coding for the CHAD protein is in the same genetic context of the enzyme polyphosphate kinase (PPK), which is in charge of PolyP synthesis. Particularly, the group of ppk and CHAD genes is highly conserved. Metallosphaera sedula and other acidophilic archaea used in biomining also contain CHAD proteins. These archaea show high levels of identity in genes coding for a cluster having the same organization. Amongst these genes are chad and ppx. In general, both biomining bacteria and archaea contain high PolyP levels and are highly resistant to heavy metals. Therefore, the presence of this conserved genetic organization suggests a high relevance for their metabolism. It has been formerly reported that a crystallized CHAD protein contains a copper-binding site. Based on this previous knowledge, in the present report, it was determined that all analyzed CHAD proteins are very conserved at their structural level. In addition, it was found that the lack of YgiF, an Escherichia coli CHAD-containing protein, decreases copper resistance in this bacterium. This phenotype was not only complemented by transforming E. coli with YgiF but also by expressing CHAD from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in it. Interestingly, the strains in which the possible copper-binding sites were mutated were also more metal sensitive. Based on these results, we propose that CHAD proteins are involved in copper resistance in microorganisms. These findings are very interesting and may eventually improve biomining operations in the future. © 2024 by the authors.},

At core-to-wall ratios of 1:6 and 1:2, WA and WH coacervates had the highest encapsulation efficiencies (95.93 % and 98.86 %) and yields (83.33 % and 64.66 %). Optimal BEO-loaded WA coacervates well-scavenged ABTS and DPPH radicals, inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli growth, and showed higher viscosity and stability than BEO-WH coacervates. Uniform-morphology WA coacervates ensured controlled BEO release in food simulants. XRD and SEM revealed reduced crystallinity and porous structure in BEO-loaded WA coacervates, while thermal analysis showed superior stability over BEO-WH coacervates. BEO-loaded WA coacervates could be a potential preservative, as they evinced reduced bacterial count (5.81 log CFU/g on day 15) and retained sensory attributes (color and odor >4.0) in MCM during cold storage. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Astrocytes have recently gained attention as key players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Numerous differentiation protocols have been developed to study human astrocytes in vitro. However, the properties of the resulting glia are inconsistent, making it difficult to select an appropriate method for a given research question. Therefore, we compared three approaches for the generation of iPSC-derived astrocytes. We performed a detailed analysis using a widely used long serum-free (LSFP) and short serum-free (SSFP) protocol, as well as a TUSP protocol using serum for a limited time of differentiation. Results: We used RNA sequencing and immunochemistry to characterize the cultures. Astrocytes generated by the LSFP and SSFP methods differed significantly in their characteristics from those generated by the TUSP method using serum. The TUSP astrocytes had a less neuronal pattern, showed a higher degree of extracellular matrix formation, and were more mature. The short-term presence of FBS in the medium facilitated the induction of astroglia characteristics but did not result in reactive astrocytes. Data from cell-type deconvolution analysis applied to bulk transcriptomes from the cultures assessed their similarity to primary and fetal human astrocytes. Conclusions: Overall, our analyses highlight the need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of a given differentiation protocol for solving specific research tasks or drug discovery studies with iPSC-derived astrocytes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Aeromonas hydrophila is a widely recognized broad-spectrum pathogen that primarily targets the gastrointestinal tract. Type IV pili (T4P) are proteinaceous nano-machines located on the bacterial cell surface, playing a crucial role in host colonization and infection. Regrettably, the T4P systems of A. hydrophila remain largely underexplored. Methods: A. hydrophila genomes with complete genome assembly and annotation reports up to 31 March 2023, were obtained from the NCBI Genome database or KEGG genome database, followed by a global search for T4P secretion system genes. Protein sequences of these manually curetted genes were used as secondary quarry for Synteny analysis. Protein–protein interaction analysis was performed by string analysis and in silico study of genomic islands. Results: We identified 27 orthologs of type IV pili (T4P) nano-machine components in A. hydrophila. These orthologs are primarily distributed across three operons: pilABCD, pilMNOPQ, and pilVWXY. While the first two operons are commonly found in all experimental genomes, the presence of the pilVWXY operon, coding for 11 orthologs, is reported here for the first time in A. hydrophila. Notably, the complete pilVWXY operon is absent in nonvirulent strains. A genomic islands study between a nonvirulent and hypervirulent strain also confirms absence of most of the genes coded by pilVWXY in nonvirulent strain. Interestingly, among the 51 experimental genomes analyzed, the pilVWXY operon was completely absent in 10 strains, most of which are categorized as nonvirulent; Conclusions: The distribution of two major type IV pili (T4P) nano-machines, PilABCDMNOPQ and PilVWXY, is reported here for the first time in A. hydrophila. Additionally, this study suggests a potential role for the PilVWXY nano-machine in establishing human disease. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Antimony-resistant bacteria are potential natural resources for the bioremediation of mining soil pollution. A Raoultella sp. 64 strain was isolated from antimony-contaminated soil. To enhance its Sb resistance abilities, this strain was transported into space aboard the Shenzhou spacecraft for space breeding, resulting in a mutant strain, Raoultella sp. D9. The whole genomes of Raoultella sp. 64 and mutant strain Raoultella sp. D9 were sequenced, revealing the genomic information for the bacterium. Comparative genomic analysis was then carried out to identify differential functional genes. The adsorption conditions for Sb(III) were optimized and refined. Further, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine the adsorption of antimony. Results show that strain D9 exhibits a higher tolerance to Sb(III), and Sb resistance genes were identified in both Raoultella sp. 64 and D9. Analysis of the differential functional genes indicated that the increased copy number of plsX may lead to a higher lipid content in the cell membrane, thereby enhancing the cell’s resistance to heavy metals. Mutant strain D9 exhibited better biosorption capacity compared to strain 64. FTIR studies showed that key functional groups, including -OH, C-N, C-H, and C-O, are likely to have participated in Sb(III) biosorption. Further study of the differential functional genes could provide a basis for future research and the subsequent development of technologies for the remediation of Sb-contaminated sites. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Acid sulfate soils impact surrounding ecosystems with pronounced environmental damage via leaching of strong acidity along with the concurrent mobilization of toxic metals present in the soils and, in consequence, they are often described as the nastiest soils on Earth. Within Sweden, acid sulfate soils are distributed mainly under the maximum Holocene marine limit that stretches the length of the country, some 2000 km north to south. Despite only minor geographical differences in the geochemical composition of the Swedish acid sulfate soils, their field oxidation zone microbial community compositions differ along a north–south regional divide. This study compared the 16S rRNA gene amplicon-based microbial community compositions of field oxidation zones (field tested pH < 4.0) with reduced zone samples (field tested pH > 6.5) collected from the same field sites throughout Sweden that had acidified (final pH < 4.0) after laboratory incubation at approximately 20°C. The previously identified regional differences observed in field oxidation zone microbial compositions were notably absent in the laboratory incubation samples. Instead, a commonly shared community was selected for with few statistically significant differences regardless of regional origin. For instance, the potential eurypsychrophilic Baltobacteraceae family was found in higher relative abundances in the northerly region of the field oxidation zone samples than the southern regions and was notably absent from the laboratory incubation samples. Furthermore, the microbial communities of the laboratory incubation samples were dominated by acidophilic autotrophic Acidithiobacillaceae and chemoheterotrophic Rhodanobacteraceae and Burkholderiaceae that have optimal growth temperatures (≥ 20°C) greater than what was experienced by the field oxidation zone samples when sampled (~2°C–9°C). These data suggested that in the absence of significant geochemical differences, temperature was the predominant driver of microbial community composition in Swedish acid sulfate soil materials. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Iron (Fe) is the fourth most abundant element on the planet, and iron-oxidising bacteria (FeOB) play an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of this metal in nature. FeOB stands out as Fe oxidisers in microaerophilic environments, and new members of this group have been increasingly discussed in the literature, even though their isolation can still be challenging. Among these bacteria is the Gallionellaceae family, mainly composed of neutrophilic FeOB, highlighting Gallionella ferruginea, and nitrite-oxidiser genera. In the previous metagenomic study of the biofilm and sediments of the cooling system from the Irapé hydroelectric power plant (HPP-Irapé), 5% of the total bacteria sequences were related to Gallionellaceae, being 99% unclassified at genus level. Thus, in the present study, a phylogenetic tree based on this family was constructed, in order to search for shared and unique Gallionellaceae signatures in a deep phylogenetic level affiliation and correlated them with geomorphologic characteristics. The results revealed that Gallionella and Ferrigenium were ubiquitous reflecting their ability to adapt to various locations in the power plant. The cave was considered a hotspot for neutrophilic FeOB since it harboured most of the Gallionellaceae diversity. Microscopic biosignatures were detected only in the CS1 sample, which presented abundance of the stalk-forming Ferriphaselus and of the sheath-forming Crenothrix. Further studies are required to provide more detailed insights on Gallionellaceae distribution and diversity patterns in hydroelectric power plants, particularly its biotechnological potential in this industry. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

	abstract = {Multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a high-priority pathogen per the World Health Organization, poses a global threat due to carbapenem resistance and limited antibiotic treatments. Using the bioinformatic tools CRISPRCasFinder, CRISPRCasTyper, CRISPRloci, and CRISPRImmunity, we analyzed the genome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and revealed an orphan CRISPR system, suggesting it may be a remnant of a type IV system due to the presence of the DinG protein. This system comprises two CRISPR arrays and noteworthy DinG and Cas3 proteins, supporting recent evidence about the association between type IV and I CRISPR systems. Additionally, we demonstrated a co-evolutionary relationship between the orphan CRISPR system in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and the mobile genetic element and prophages identified. One self-targeting spacer was identified, often associated with bacterial evolution and autoimmunity, and no Acr proteins. This research opens avenues for studying how these CRISPR arrays regulate pathogenicity and for developing alternative strategies using its endogenous orphan CRISPR system against carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. © 2024 Delgado-Nungaray et al.

	abstract = {The Aeolian archipelago is known worldwide for its volcanic activity and hydrothermal emissions, of mainly carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide are minor components of these emissions which together can feed large quantities of bacteria and archaea that do contribute to the removal of these notorious greenhouse gases. Here we analyzed the metagenome of samples taken from the Levante bay on Vulcano Island, Italy. Using a gene-centric approach, the hydrothermal vent community appeared to be dominated by Proteobacteria, and Sulfurimonas was the most abundant genus. Metabolic reconstructions highlight a prominent role of formaldehyde oxidation and the reverse TCA cycle in carbon fixation. [NiFe]-hydrogenases seemed to constitute the preferred strategy to oxidize H2, indicating that besides H2S, H2 could be an essential electron donor in this system. Moreover, the sulfur cycle analysis showed a high abundance and diversity of sulfate reduction genes underpinning the H2S production. This study covers the diversity and metabolic potential of the microbial soil community in Levante bay and adds to our understanding of the biogeochemistry of volcanic ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Bacillus sp. THPS1 is a novel strain isolated from a high-temperature hot spring in Thailand, exhibiting distinctive genomic features that enable adaptation to an extreme environment. This study aimed to characterize the genomic and functional attributes of Bacillus sp. THPS1 to understand its adaptation strategies and evaluate its potential for biotechnological applications. The draft genome is 5.38 Mbp with a GC content of 35.67%, encoding 5606 genes, including those linked to stress response and sporulation, which are essential for survival in high-temperature conditions. Phylogenetic analysis and average nucleotide identity (ANI) values confirmed its classification as a distinct species within the Bacillus genus. Pangenome analysis involving 19 others closely related thermophilic Bacillus species identified 1888 singleton genes associated with heat resistance, sporulation, and specialized metabolism, suggesting adaptation to nutrient-deficient, high-temperature environments. Genomic analysis revealed 12 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including those for polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, highlighting its potential for synthesizing secondary metabolites that may facilitate its adaptation. Additionally, the presence of three Siphoviridae phage regions and 96 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) suggests significant genomic plasticity, whereas the existence of five CRISPR arrays implies an advanced defense mechanism against phage infections, contributing to genomic stability. The distinctive genomic features and functional capacities of Bacillus sp. THPS1 make it a promising candidate for biotechnological applications, particularly in the production of heat-stable enzymes and the development of resilient bioformulations. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic and neglected disease across the world causing huge loss of life and economy. In this study, we did whole genome sequencing of one Leptospira isolate and a comparative genomic analysis with 69 other species of Leptospira available in RefSeq database provided insight into taxonomic and evolutionary relationship between species. AAI and whole genome based phylogenomic analysis established 3 clusters of Leptospira i.e. pathogenic, intermediate and saprophytic correlating with level of virulence of species. Leptospira has large closed core genome of 1038 genes and an open pan genome with 20,822 genes. The mobilome related genes were found mainly in pan-genome of pathogenic clade. A total of 498 genes have been identified as virulomes, with 329 virulent genes exhibiting presence/absence in various Leptospira species contributing to each species specific virulence profile. The hierarchical clustering of the congregated pathogenic genes yielded five groups, each with a distinct pattern of predominant genes that were either unique or common among clades, indicating lineage uniqueness. Most of the virulent gene pool identified were significantly enriched in COG functional categories of Nucleotide transport and metabolism, Intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport, cell motility and amino acid transport & metabolism. Pathogenic leptospires exhibit fewer clade-specific genes than non-pathogenic and intermediate leptospires, indicating gene loss and gain events in the evolution of pathogenic leptospires from non-pathogenic. The study’s clade-specific and virulent genes can be utilised as markers for defining clade and associated virulence levels in any new Leptospira isolates. Wet-lab validation of virulent genes will help in accurately targeting pathogenic pathways of Leptospira and controlling leptospirosis. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Extreme acidophiles thrive in acidic environments, confront a multitude of challenges, and demonstrate remarkable adaptability in their metabolism to cope with the ever-changing environmental fluctuations, which encompass variations in temperature, pH levels, and the availability of electron acceptors and donors. The survival and proliferation of members within the Acidithiobacillia class rely on the deployment of transcriptional regulatory systems linked to essential physiological traits. The study of these transcriptional regulatory systems provides valuable insights into critical processes, such as energy metabolism and nutrient assimilation, and how they integrate into major genetic-metabolic circuits. In this study, we examined the transcriptional regulatory repertoires and potential interactions of forty-three Acidithiobacillia complete and draft genomes, encompassing nine species. To investigate the function and diversity of Transcription Factors (TFs) and their DNA Binding Sites (DBSs), we conducted a genome-wide comparative analysis, which allowed us to identify these regulatory elements in representatives of Acidithiobacillia. We classified TFs into gene families and compared their occurrence among all representatives, revealing conservation patterns across the class. The results identified conserved regulators for several pathways, including iron and sulfur oxidation, the main pathways for energy acquisition, providing new evidence for viable regulatory interactions and branch-specific conservation in Acidithiobacillia. The identification of TFs and DBSs not only corroborates existing experimental information for selected species, but also introduces novel candidates for experimental validation. Moreover, these promising candidates have the potential for further extension to new representatives within the class. © 2023 Institut Pasteur},

	abstract = {Environmental contamination caused by toxic metals is a global concern due to their toxicity, prolonged persistence, and non-biodegradability. Bioremediation is one of the most widely used eco-friendly techniques to remove heavy metal contamination. Synthetic biology transpires as a promising approach to enhance bioremediation efficacy by increasing the expressions of tailor-made microorganisms at the gene, metabolome, and protein levels to achieve site-specific remediation targets. This review article provides a holistic perspective on synthetic biology approaches including genetic and metabolic engineering, whole microbial biosensors, and genetically encoded metal binding proteins along with omics and computational tools and databases to facilitate microbial remediation of heavy metals. While synthetic biology holds the potential to revolutionize many aspects of bioremediation, it also raises concerns regarding ethical issues and ecological implications associated with the safe deployment of synthetic microbial models into the environment. Therefore, this article also discusses the challenges, limitations, and proposed solutions of synthetic biology approaches and their future prospects in the field of heavy metal bioremediation.

	abstract = {Thermoplasmata archaea, renowned for their acidophilic and thermophilic traits, have been implicated in methanogenic metabolism across diverse environments. However, their metabolic capabilities in nonacidic settings remain understudied. This metagenomic investigation unveils the microbiome dynamics and metabolic processes within nonacidic estuary-ocean sediments across 19 sites (seven groups) in the Pearl River Estuary and South China Sea regions. Remarkably, the microbiomes exhibited rapid adaptation and compositional consistency despite spatial heterogeneity, suggesting the overriding influences of salinity, pH, and nutrient availability. Metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed prevalent modules for amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, vitamin, and carbohydrate metabolism, indicating community adaptation to this environment. Additionally, the high occurrence of heterodisulfide reductase (hdrA) genes implicated potential roles in CoM-S-S-CoB degradation. Notably, we discovered a novel Thermoplasmata-like genome (MAG3 in g3) that, despite sharing core genomic traits with known Thermoplasmata, harbored distinct genetic variabilities. Phylogenetic evidence robustly affiliated the Thermoplasmata-like archaeon with methanogenesis pathways, suggesting its potential involvement in CoM-S-S-CoB degradation under nonacidic conditions. This study enhances the understanding of microbiome composition and metabolic processes and highlights the pivotal contribution of Thermoplasmata archaea to sulfur cycling within nonacidic estuarine-ocean sediments. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Odour emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a growing concern due to their negative impact on both workers and surrounding communities, with compounds like H2S, NH3 and volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) contributing to air pollution and potential health issues. Biological technologies, such as biofilters (BFs), are an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective platform for odour control in WWTPs. The use of by-products from WWTPs as packed bed material in BFs would support a circular economy within the water sector. This research evaluates the performance of iron-doped pelletised compost from WWTP sludge by-products as packing material in BFs during the removal of H2S, NH3 and VOCs at empty bed residence time (EBRT). The experimental set-up consisted of three 8-L BFs filled with commercial iron-doped clay pellets (control), pelletised sewage sludge compost and pelletised sewage sludge compost doped with Fe salts. The three BFs achieved a complete removal of H2S and NH3 at EBRTs of 60, 45, 30 and 20 s, while VOC removal exceeded 90 % at EBRTs of 60 and 45 s. The pelletised iron-doped sewage sludge compost supported VOCs removals above 92 % at 60, 45 and 30 s of EBRT. This bed material promoted the growth of genera such as Thermomonas and Thiobacillus among others. This research demonstrated the potential of using WWTP sludge by-products as bed materials in BFs for odour abatement, thus supporting the implementation of the circular economy concept within the integrated water cycle. © 2025 The Authors},

Notably, a gene cluster upregulated during iron oxidation was identified. This cluster contains genes encoding for cytochromes that share sequence similarity with the known iron-oxidase, Cyc2. Interestingly, these cytochromes, conserved in both Bacteria and Archaea, do not exhibit the typical β-barrel structure of Cyc2. This cluster potentially encodes a biological nanowire-like transmembrane complex containing multiple redox proteins spanning the inner membrane, periplasm, outer membrane, and extracellular space. The upregulation of key genes associated with this complex during iron-oxidizing conditions was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. These findings were further supported by electromicrobiological methods, which demonstrated negative current production by G. bivora in a three-electrode system poised at a cathodic potential. This research provides significant insights into the biological function of chemolithoautotrophic iron oxidation. © 2024 The Authors. Environmental Microbiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Subcellular compartments often serve to store nutrients or sequester labile or toxic compounds. As bacteria mostly do not possess membrane-bound organelles, they often have to rely on protein-based compartments. Encapsulins are one of the most prevalent protein-based compartmentalization strategies found in prokaryotes. Here, we show that desulfurase encapsulins can sequester and store large amounts of crystalline elemental sulfur. We determine the 1.78-angstrom cryo-EM structure of a 24-nanometer desulfurase-loaded encapsulin. Elemental sulfur crystals can be formed inside the encapsulin shell in a desulfurase-dependent manner with l-cysteine as the sulfur donor. Sulfur accumulation can be influenced by the concentration and type of sulfur source in growth medium. The selectively permeable protein shell allows the storage of redox-labile elemental sulfur by excluding cellular reducing agents, while encapsulation substantially improves desulfurase activity and stability. These findings represent an example of a protein compartment able to accumulate and store elemental sulfur. © 2024 American Association for the Advancement of Science. All rights reserved.},

Through systematic integration of these approaches, we reveal pivotal synergies and potential technological innovations that can propel multi-product biorefinery systems. Persistent challenges, particularly in reconciling complex metabolic flux balancing with regulatory compliance requirements, are analyzed. Nevertheless, advancements in systems biology, next-generation bioprocess engineering, and artificial intelligence-enhanced computational modeling present viable pathways for overcoming these obstacles.

	abstract = {The growing amount of tannery sludge (TS) generated from leather processing often undergoes uncontrolled landfilling, or open dumping, releasing a significant volume of harmful pollutants, including carcinogenic chromium (Cr) into the air, water, and soil. Therefore, the sustainable TS management through advanced valorization technologies becomes vital to align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and mitigate the adverse environmental, health, and social impacts. Moreover, TS, as biomass, can be considered a renewable energy source for bioenergy generation, which could be a viable solution for meeting contemporary environmental standards and expediting transition towards a circular economy. However, TS valorization is sensitive and critical due to the potential risk of transforming Cr(III) to Cr(VI) during the valorization process. Therefore, there is an urgency to consider efficient and holistic TS valorization technologies in the design, implementation, and operations phases to avoid any environmental and health hazards. In pursuit of this goal, this systematic literature review (SLR) comprehensively and critically analyzes the existing TS valorization processes to develop sustainable energy recovery solutions from TS. This SLR contributes uniquely to the existing literature in different ways. Firstly, it provides a critical evaluation of the current TS valorization technologies identifying the available waste-to-energy recovery options. Secondly, the review encompasses extensive research from three reputed databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, without temporal restrictions to offer a comprehensive understanding of current TS management practices and available valorization techniques. Moreover, the review categorized 124 published papers into distinct groups, revealing promising avenues for future research in this field. The findings indicated that most of the work concentrating on Chrome (Cr) recovery, pyrolysis, anaerobic co-digestion, and solidification while gasification and biodiesel or biofuel production from TS remained largely unexplored. Additionally, vital aspects such as process optimization, life cycle assessment of different valorization techniques, environmental, economy, energy, emergy, and exergy (5E) analysis, life cycle energy balance, and techno-economic analysis including exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental are completely absent in the literature. Future studies need to concentrate on process optimization, exergy and energy analysis, and techno-economic assessment including exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analysis to understand the feasibility and environmental benefits of various TS valorization technologies and to develop industry-scale valorization plants for TS management in an economically and ecologically sustainable manner. Moreover, the review will serve as a comprehensive guide for scholars, authorities, and stakeholders to advance research in this field and formulate policies for the eco-friendly management of TS, paving the way towards clean energy solutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

However, synthetic biology is starting to play a more direct role in environmental protection. Toxic chemicals released by industries and agriculture endanger the environment, disrupting ecosystem balance and biodiversity loss. This review highlights synthetic biology approaches that can help environmental protection by providing remediation systems capable of sensing and responding to specific pollutants.

	abstract = {Background: Despite GC variation constitutes a fundamental element of genome and species diversity, the precise mechanisms driving it remain unclear. The abundant sequence data available for the ITS2, a commonly employed phylogenetic marker in plants, offers an exceptional resource for exploring the GC variation across angiosperms. Results: A comprehensive selection of 8666 species, comprising 165 genera, 63 families, and 30 orders were used for the analyses. The alignment of ITS2 sequence-structures and partitioning of secondary structures into paired and unpaired regions were performed using 4SALE. Substitution rates and frequencies among GC base-pairs in the paired regions of ITS2 were calculated using RNA-specific models in the PHASE package. The results showed that the distribution of ITS2 GC contents on the angiosperm phylogeny was heterogeneous, but their increase was generally associated with ITS2 sequence homogenization, thereby supporting the occurrence of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) during the concerted evolution of ITS2. Additionally, the GC content in the paired regions of the ITS2 secondary structure was significantly higher than that of the unpaired regions, indicating the selection of GC for thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, the RNA substitution models demonstrated that base-pair transformations favored both the elevation and fixation of GC in the paired regions, providing further support for gBGC. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the significance of secondary structure in GC investigation, which demonstrate that both gBGC and structure-based selection are influential factors driving angiosperm ITS2 GC content. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Leakages of cold, methane-rich fluids from subsurface reservoirs to the sea floor are termed cold seeps. Recent exploration of the deep sea has shed new light on the microbial communities in cold seeps. However, conventional metagenomic methods largely rely on reference databases and neglect the phylogeny of functional genes. Results: In this study, we developed the REMIRGE program to retrieve the full-length functional genes from shotgun metagenomic reads and fully explored the phylogenetic diversity in cold seep sediments. The abundance and diversity of functional genes involved in the methane, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles differed in the non-seep site and five cold seep sites. In one Haima cold seep site, the divergence of functional groups was observed at the centimeter scale of sediment depths, with the surface layer potentially acting as a reservoir of microbial species and functions. Additionally, positive correlations were found between specific gene sequence clusters of relevant genes, indicating coupling occurred within specific functional groups. Conclusion: REMIRGE revealed divergent phylogenetic diversity of functional groups and functional pathway preferences in a deep-sea cold seep at finer scales, which could not be detected by conventional methods. Our work highlights that phylogenetic information is conducive to more comprehensive functional profiles, and REMIRGE has the potential to uncover more new insights from shotgun metagenomic data.

	abstract = {Iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria are well known to colonize deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields around the world where iron-rich fluids are discharged into oxic seawater. How inter-field and intra-field differences in geochemistry influence the diversity of Zetaproteobacteria, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize Zetaproteobacteria phylogenomic diversity, metabolic potential, and morphologies of the iron oxides they form, with a focus on the recently discovered Fåvne vent field. Located along the Mohns ridge in the Arctic, this vent field is a unique study site with vent fluids containing both iron and hydrogen with thick iron microbial mats (Fe mats) covering porously venting high-temperature (227–267°C) black smoker chimneys. Through genome-resolved metagenomics, we demonstrate that Zetaproteobacteria, Ghiorsea spp., likely produce tubular iron oxide sheaths dominating the Fe mats at Fåvne, as observed via microscopy. With these structures, Ghiorsea may provide a surface area for members of other abundant taxa such as Campylobacterota, Gammaproteobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria. Furthermore, Ghiorsea likely oxidizes both iron and hydrogen present in the fluids, with several Ghiorsea populations co-existing in the same niche. Homologs of Zetaproteobacteria Ni,Fe hydrogenases and iron oxidation gene cyc2 were found in genomes of other community members, suggesting exchange of these genes could have happened in similar environments. Our study provides new insights into Zetaproteobacteria in hydrothermal vents, their diversity, energy metabolism and niche formation. © 2023 Hribovšek et al.},

	abstract = {Bacillus toyonensis SFC 500-1E is a member of the consortium SFC 500-1 able to remove Cr(VI) and simultaneously tolerate high phenol concentrations. In order to elucidate mechanisms utilized by this strain during the bioremediation process, the differential expression pattern of proteins was analyzed when it grew with or without Cr(VI) (10 mg/L) and Cr(VI) + phenol (10 and 300 mg/L), through two complementary proteomic approaches: gel-based (Gel-LC) and gel-free (shotgun) nanoUHPLC-ESI–MS/MS. A total of 400 differentially expressed proteins were identified, out of which 152 proteins were down-regulated under Cr(VI) and 205 up-regulated in the presence of Cr(VI) + phenol, suggesting the extra effort made by the strain to adapt itself and keep growing when phenol was also added. The major metabolic pathways affected include carbohydrate and energetic metabolism, followed by lipid and amino acid metabolism. Particularly interesting were also ABC transporters and the iron-siderophore transporter as well as transcriptional regulators that can bind metals. Stress-associated global response involving the expression of thioredoxins, SOS response, and chaperones appears to be crucial for the survival of this strain under treatment with both contaminants. This research not only provided a deeper understanding of B. toyonensis SFC 500-1E metabolic role in Cr(VI) and phenol bioremediation process but also allowed us to complete an overview of the consortium SFC 500-1 behavior. This may contribute to an improvement in its use as a bioremediation strategy and also provides a baseline for further research.

	abstract = {Introduction: The microbial-induced restoration of ferruginous crusts (canga), which partially cover iron deposits and host unique ecosystems, is a promising alternative for reducing the environmental impacts of the iron mining industry. Methods: To investigate the potential of microbial action to accelerate the reduction and oxidation of iron in substrates rich in hematite and goethite, four different microbial treatments (water only as a control − W; culture medium only − MO; medium + microbial consortium − MI; medium + microbial consortium + soluble iron − MIC) were periodically applied to induce iron dissolution and subsequent precipitation. Except for W, all the treatments resulted in the formation of biocemented blocks. Results: MO and MI treatments resulted in significant goethite dissolution, followed by precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides and an iron sulfate phase, due to iron oxidation, in addition to the preservation of microfossils. In the MIC treatment, biofilms were identified, but with few mineralogical changes in the iron-rich particles, indicating less iron cycling compared to the MO or MI treatment. Regarding microbial diversity, iron-reducing families, such as Enterobacteriaceae, were found in all microbially treated substrates. Discussion: However, the presence of Bacillaceae indicates the importance of fermentative bacteria in accelerating the dissolution of iron minerals. The acceleration of iron cycling was also promoted by microorganisms that couple nitrate reduction with Fe(II) oxidation. These findings demonstrate a sustainable and streamlined opportunity for restoration in mining areas.

	abstract = {There are few biophysical studies or structural characterizations of the type IV pilin system of extremophile bacteria, such as the acidophilic Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. We set out to analyze their pili-comprising proteins, pilins, because these extracellular proteins are in constant interaction with protons of the acidic medium in which At. thiooxidans grows. We used the web server Operon Mapper to analyze and identify the cluster codified by the minor pilin of At. thiooxidans. In addition, we carried an in-silico characterization of such pilins using the VL-XT algorithm of PONDR® server. Our results showed that structural disorder prevails more in pilins of At. thiooxidans than in non-acidophilic bacteria. Further computational characterization showed that the pilins of At. thiooxidans are significantly enriched in hydroxy (serine and threonine) and amide (glutamine and asparagine) residues, and significantly reduced in charged residues (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine and lysine). Similar results were obtained when comparing pilins from other Acidithiobacillus and other acidophilic bacteria from another genus versus neutrophilic bacteria, suggesting that these properties are intrinsic to pilins from acidic environments, most likely by maintaining solubility and stability in harsh conditions. These results give guidelines for the application of extracellular proteins of acidophiles in protein engineering. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

However, the vast majority of these spacers have not yet been associated with the virus they recognize, and it has been named CRISPR dark matter. By analyzing the spacers of tens of thousands of genomes from six bacterial species, we have been able to reduce the CRISPR dark matter from 80% to as low as 15% in some of the species. In addition, we have observed that, when a genome presents CRISPR-Cas systems, this is accompanied by particular sets of membrane proteins. Our results suggest that when bacteria present membrane proteins that make it compete better in its environment and these proteins are, in turn, receptors for specific phages, they would be forced to acquire CRISPR-Cas.

	abstract = {Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are terminal members of any anaerobic food chain. For example, they critically influence the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and metals (natural environment) as well as the corrosion of civil infrastructure (built environment). The United States alone spends nearly $4 billion to address the biocorrosion challenges of SRB. It is important to analyze the genetic mechanisms of these organisms under environmental stresses. The current study uses complementary methodologies, viz., transcriptome-wide marker gene panel mapping and gene clustering analysis to decipher the stress mechanisms in four SRB. Here, the accessible RNA-sequencing data from the public domains were mined to identify the key transcriptional signatures. Crucial transcriptional candidate genes of Desulfovibrio spp. were accomplished and validated the gene cluster prediction. In addition, the unique transcriptional signatures of Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis (OA-G20) at graphene and copper interfaces were discussed using in-house RNA-sequencing data. Furthermore, the comparative genomic analysis revealed 12,821 genes with translation, among which 10,178 genes were in homolog families and 2643 genes were in singleton families were observed among the 4 genomes studied. The current study paves a path for developing predictive deep learning tools for interpretable and mechanistic learning analysis of the SRB gene regulation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {In this study, a genomic approach was employed to evaluate the metabolic potentials and taxonomic classification of the halophilic genus Halarchaeum. Genomic analysis revealed that Halarchaeum members exhibit a predilection for amino acids as their primary energy source in high-salinity environments over carbohydrates. Genome analysis unveiled the presence of crucial genes associated with metabolic pathways, including the Embden–Meyerhof pathway, semi-phosphorylative Entner–Doudoroff pathway, and the urea cycle. Furthermore, the genomic analysis indicated that Halarchaeum members employ diverse mechanisms for osmotic regulation (encompassing both salt-in and salt-out strategies). Halarchaeum members also encode genes to alleviate acid and heat stress. The average nucleotide identity value between Halarchaeum solikamskense and Halarchaeum nitratireducens exceeded the established threshold (95%–96%) for defining distinct species. This high similarity suggests a close relationship between these two species, prompting the proposal to reclassify Halarchaeum solikamskense as a heterotypic synonym of Halarchaeum nitratireducens. The results of this study contribute to our knowledge of taxonomic classification and shed light on the adaptive strategies employed by Halarchaeum species in their specific ecological niches. © The Author(s) 2024.

	abstract = {Dinitrogen (N2) fixation provides nitrogen sources supporting active chemoautotrophic processes in submarine hydrothermal systems. Here, the diazotrophic phylogenetic diversity and N2 fixation profile were investigated in depth along a sharp biogeochemical gradient from the hydrothermal vents to ambient seawater in a shallow submarine hydrothermal system (SHS) off Kueishantao Islet, Taiwan. Diazotrophic community compositions in the SHS covered all four known nifH clusters (I, II, III, and IV) and contained both characteristics of diazotrophic communities in deep-sea hydrothermal systems and terrestrial geothermal systems. The seawater around the vents was primarily dominated by nifH phylotypes affiliated with chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing and iron-reducing bacteria. In contrast, in the seawater directly above the hydrothermal vents, the nifH community markedly contained diverse heterotrophic bacteria. The analysis, which focused on amino acid composition, protein spatial structure, and the possible co-occurrence of alternative nitrogenases in the presence of molybdenum-nitrogenase, further revealed that diazotrophic nitrogenase found around the hydrothermal vents exhibits potential molecular adaptations to high temperature, low pH, and sulfur-rich conditions. The relatively low N2 fixation rates (NFRs) were observed around the vents, where high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds were present. However, notably, high NFRs were detected in seawater directly above the hydrothermal vents, which were 2–5 times higher than those at the reference site. The abundant iron, along with the depletion of nitrogen nutrients potentially resulting from nitrogen assimilation and loss processes, may have led to a high iron:nitrogen ratio, inducing the observed high NFRs. The co-occurrence of diverse nifH-containing heterotrophic bacteria and high NFRs suggests that these heterotrophs may play a major role in N2 fixation in this environment. This study suggests that the SHSs may be potential hotspots for marine N2 fixation, contributing significantly to the global ocean's N2 fixation budget and warranting further investigation. © 2023},

	abstract = {The majority of the microbial diversity in nature has not been recovered through cultivation. Enrichment is a classical technique widely used in the selective cultivation of specific taxa. Whether enrichment is suitable for cultivation studies that aim to recover large numbers of species remains little explored. To address this issue, we evaluated the potential of enrichment pretreatment in the cultivation of bacteria from marine sediments. Upon obtaining and classifying a total of 943 pure cultures from chitin and cellulose enrichment pretreatment systems and a control system, our results showed that species obtained using enrichment pretreatment differed greatly from those without enrichment. Multiple enrichment media and different enrichment times increased the number of cultivated species in a sample. Amplicon sequencing showed that the increased relative abundance during pretreatment contributed greatly to bacterial cultivation. The testing of degradation abilities against chitin and cellulose and the whole-genome sequencing of representative strains suggested that microorganism–microorganism interactions play roles in the expanded diversity of cultivated bacteria. This study provides new insights into the abilities of enrichment in exploring cultivable diversity and mining microbial resources. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Active hydrothermal vents create extreme conditions characterized by high temperatures, low pH levels, and elevated concentrations of heavy metals and other trace elements. These conditions support unique ecosystems where chemolithoautotrophs serve as primary producers. The steep temperature and pH gradients from the vent mouth to its periphery provide a wide range of microhabitats for these specialized microorganisms. However, their metabolic functions, adaptations in response to these gradients, and coping mechanisms under extreme conditions remain areas of limited knowledge. In this study, we conducted temperature gradient incubations of hydrothermal fluids from moderate (pH = 5.6) and extremely (pH = 2.2) acidic vents. Combining the DNA-stable isotope probing technique and subsequent metagenomics, we identified active chemolithoautotrophs under different temperature and pH conditions and analyzed their specific metabolic mechanisms. Results: We found that the carbon fixation activities of Nautiliales in vent fluids were significantly increased from 45 to 65 °C under moderately acidic condition, while their heat tolerance was reduced under extremely acidic conditions. In contrast, Campylobacterales actively fixed carbon under both moderately and extremely acidic conditions under 30 − 45 °C. Compared to Campylobacterales, Nautiliales were found to lack the Sox sulfur oxidation system and instead use NAD(H)-linked glutamate dehydrogenase to boost the reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. Additionally, they exhibit a high genetic potential for high activity of cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase in oxygen respiration and hydrogen oxidation at high temperatures. In terms of high-temperature adaption, the rgy gene plays a critical role in Nautiliales by maintaining DNA stability at high temperature. Genes encoding proteins involved in proton export, including the membrane arm subunits of proton-pumping NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, K+ accumulation, selective transport of charged molecules, permease regulation, and formation of the permeability barrier of bacterial outer membranes, play essential roles in enabling Campylobacterales to adapt to extremely acidic conditions. Conclusions: Our study provides in-depth insights into how high temperature and low pH impact the metabolic processes of energy and main elements in chemolithoautotrophs living in hydrothermal ecosystems, as well as the mechanisms they use to adapt to the extreme hydrothermal conditions.

	abstract = {Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) mediate the shuffling of genes among organisms. They contribute to the spread of virulence and antibiotic resistance (AMR) genes in human pathogens, such as the particularly problematic group of ESKAPE pathogens. Here, we performed the first systematic analysis of MGEs, including plasmids, prophages, and integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements (ICEs/IMEs), across all ESKAPE pathogens. We found that different MGE types are asymmetrically distributed across these pathogens, and that most horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events are restricted by phylum or genus. We show that the MGEs proteome is involved in diverse functional processes and distinguish widespread proteins within the ESKAPE context. Moreover, anti-CRISPRs and AMR genes are overrepresented in the ESKAPE mobilome. Our results also underscore species-specific trends shaping the number of MGEs, AMR, and virulence genes across pairs of conspecific ESKAPE genomes with and without CRISPR-Cas systems. Finally, we observed that CRISPR spacers found on prophages, ICEs/IMEs, and plasmids have different targeting biases: while plasmid and prophage CRISPRs almost exclusively target other plasmids and prophages, respectively, ICEs/IMEs CRISPRs preferentially target prophages. Overall, our study highlights the general importance of the ESKAPE mobilome in contributing to the spread of AMR and mediating conflict among MGEs. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Metabolomics is the systematic analysis of small molecules (metabolites) in organisms or biological samples, providing an opportunity to comprehensively study interactions between metabolism and immunity in physiology and disease. Integrating metabolomics into systems immunology allows the exploration of the interactions of multilayered features in the biological system and the molecular regulatory mechanism of these features. Here, we provide an overview on recent technological developments of metabolomic applications in immunological research. To begin, two widely used metabolomics approaches are compared: targeted and untargeted metabolomics. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of the analysis workflow and the computational tools available, including sample preparation, raw spectra data preprocessing, data processing, statistical analysis, and interpretation. Third, we describe how to integrate metabolomics with other omics approaches in immunological studies using available tools. Finally, we discuss new developments in metabolomics and its prospects for immunology research.

	abstract = {Over the last half-century, microbial communities of the Kamchatka hot springs have been largely studied using molecular, radioisotopic, and cultural approaches. Generally, these results were obtained for mixed samples of water with sediments, for only hydrothermal water, or for only sediment samples. Simultaneous comparative analysis of the microbial communities of water and sediments was performed for only one Kamchatka hot spring with circumneutral pH. Here, the microbial communities of both sediments and water (separately) of hot spring #4229 (the Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka) with a temperature of 50–56 °C and pH of 3.2 were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene V4 fragment amplicon sequencing. It was revealed that the microbial community of sediments was represented by uncultured phylogenetically deep-branching lineages of archaea, such as ARK-15 within Thermoplasmatota and ‘Ca. Marsarchaeales’ from the Thermoproteota phyla. Metagenome analysis showed that these archaea most probably carried out the degradation of organic matter. The microbial community of the hot water is represented by thermoacidophilic, (micro)aerobic, chemolithoautotrophic, hydrogen- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria of the genera Hydrogenobaculum (phylum Aquificota) and Acidithiobacillus (phylum Pseudomonadota). Radioisotopic tracing and DNA-stable-isotope probing techniques proved their role as primary producers in the hot spring. The experiment revealed significant differences in the composition and functions of the microbial communities of sediments and water through the example of a typical acidic hot spring in Kamchatka. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Engineering the genetic code of an organism has been proposed to provide a firewall from natural ecosystems by preventing viral infections and gene transfer1–6. However, numerous viruses and mobile genetic elements encode parts of the translational apparatus7–9, potentially rendering a genetic-code-based firewall ineffective. Here we show that such mobile transfer RNAs (tRNAs) enable gene transfer and allow viral replication in Escherichia coli despite the genome-wide removal of 3 of the 64 codons and the previously essential cognate tRNA and release factor genes. We then establish a genetic firewall by discovering viral tRNAs that provide exceptionally efficient codon reassignment allowing us to develop cells bearing an amino acid-swapped genetic code that reassigns two of the six serine codons to leucine during translation. This amino acid-swapped genetic code renders cells resistant to viral infections by mistranslating viral proteomes and prevents the escape of synthetic genetic information by engineered reliance on serine codons to produce leucine-requiring proteins. As these cells may have a selective advantage over wild organisms due to virus resistance, we also repurpose a third codon to biocontain this virus-resistant host through dependence on an amino acid not found in nature10. Our results may provide the basis for a general strategy to make any organism safely resistant to all natural viruses and prevent genetic information flow into and out of genetically modified organisms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

A novel A. ferrooxidans strain, hereinafter referred to as strain “YQ-N3”, was isolated from sediments of a river polluted by acid mine drainage (AMD) of an abandoned mine in Shanxi, China. The whole genome sequencing results revealed that A. ferrooxidans YQ-N3 has a 3,217,720 bp genome, which is comprised of one circular chromosome and five circular plasmids (Plasmid A, Plasmid B, Plasmid C, Plasmid D, Plasmid E). Plasmid E, a new plasmid, had not been annotated in the reference database. A. ferrooxidans YQ-N3 had a close evolutionary relationship with A. ferrooxidans ATCC23270 and A. ferridurans JCM18981 and exhibited higher similarity in its genomic structure with A. ferrooxidans ATCC23270. Multiple genes related to environmental resistance and iron and sulfur metabolism were predicted from its genome. A. ferrooxidans YQ-N3 can remarkably increase the oxidation rate of Fe2+ and S0 and enhance the hydrophilicity of S0, which was supported by functional gene analysis and laboratory experiments.

	abstract = {The supplementation of conductive materials (CMs) is a promising strategy to improve the methane (CH4) yield from anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge. However, most CMs are relatively costly, and the mechanisms by which they influence microbial functional traits (e.g., direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)) remain poorly understood, which limits the application of CMs for enhancing CH4 production. Here, we investigated the effects of micro- and milli-scale particles of pyrite (an iron-based (semi)conductive waste, supplemented at doses of 5–40 g/L) on sludge digestion, and the underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that CH4 production rate and yield were improved mostly (by 20.8 % and 37.8 %, respectively) by the addition of 5 g/L micro-scale pyrite. The hydrolysis, acidification, and acetoclastic methanogenesis steps were accordingly promoted by 17.0–98.2 %, and the corresponding activities of key enzymes were elevated by 27.2–33.4 %. Pyrite enriched the populations of Anaerolineae and Burkholderiales, which are putative EPS producers according to genome-centric metagenomics, thus boosting the secretion of redox-active components in EPS and facilitating extracellular electron transport. Interestingly, pyrite may mediate “dual-drive” DIET, in which bin 116 (Syntrophobacteraceae sp.) and bin 2 (Thiobacillaceae sp.) directly transfer the electrons released by the oxidation of propionate and sulfide, respectively, to methanogen bin 28 (Methanothrix soehngenii). These results provide deep insights into the highly favorable performance of pyrite-supplemented AD systems and the microbial mechanisms. The proposed pyrite-mediated dual-drive DIET could expand the diversity of electron-donating bacteria and provide a novel microbial strategy for the simultaneous recovery of CH4 and elemental sulfur from waste organic streams in CM-supplemented AD systems. © 2022},

	abstract = {Bactrocera zonata is a fruit tree pest that typically attacks and causes heavy damage in fruit production using its sucking mouth. Researchers have started to distinguish them through molecular characterization and sequencing to control this pest. Mitochondrial genes such as COI (mtCOI) are commonly used as barcoding for identifying eukaryotes and counting insects. In the current study, the mtCOI gene has been amplified. Three samples from five locations in Karbala city were sequenced using the Sanger sequencing method. Also, symbionts bacteria linked with this insect were molecularly identified by sequencing. Four different sequences of B. zonata showed genetic diversity, and three different endosymbionts, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Acidithiobacillus sp., and Bacterium symbiont of B. zonata were molecularly identified. Different computational tools were used to compare sequences with related sequences retrieved from databases. Associated species were identified through phylogenetic analysis using the MEGA X software and confirmed with available GenBank databases. Pairwise sequence alignment showed the sequence identity of about 99% with Bactrocera zonata. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Filamentous actinomycetes, designated SL13 and SL54T, were isolated from pine litter and their taxonomic status resolved using a polyphasic approach. The isolates exhibit chemotaxonomic and morphological properties consistent with their classification in the family Streptomycetaceae. They form extensively branched substrate mycelia bearing aerial hyphae that differentiate into straight chains of cylindrical spores. The whole-organism hydrolysates contain ll-diaminopimelic acid, glucose, mannose and ribose, the predominant isoprenologue is MK-9(H8), the polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidyle-thanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and glycophospholipids, and the major fatty acids are anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C17:0. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and multilocus gene sequences of conserved housekeeping genes show that the isolates form a well-supported lineage that is most closely related to Strep-tomyces parmotrematis NBRC 115203T. All of these strains form a well-defined clade in the multilocus sequence analysis tree together with Streptantibioticus cattleyicolor DSM 46488T, Streptomyces ferralitis DSM 41836T and Streptomyces rubri-soli DSM 42083T. Draft genomes assemblies of the isolates are rich in biosynthetic gene clusters predicted to produce novel specialized metabolites and stress-related genes which provide an insight into how they have adapted to the harsh conditions that prevail in pine litter. Phylogenomically, both isolates belong to the same lineage as the type strains of S. cattleyicolor, S. ferralitis, S. parmotrematis and S. rubrisoli; these relationships are underpinned by high average amino acid identity, average nucleotide identity and genomic DNA–DNA hybridization values. These metrics confirm that isolates SL13 and SL54T belong to a novel species that is most closely related to S. parmotrematis NBRC 115203T and that these strains together with S. ferralitis DSM 41836T, S. rubrisoli DSM 42083T belong to the genus Streptantibioticus. Consequently, it is proposed that the isolates be recognized as a new Streptantibioticus species, Streptantibioticus silvisoli comb. nov., with isolate SL54T (=DSM 111111T=PCM3044T) as the type strain, and that S. ferralitis, S. parmotrematis and S. rubrisoli be transferred to the genus Strept-antibioticus as Streptantibioticus ferralitis comb. nov., Streptantibioticus parmotrematis comb. nov. and Streptantibioticus rubrisoli comb. nov. Emended descriptions are given for the genus Streptantibioticus, the family Streptomycetaceae and for Streptomyces iconiensis which was found to be a close relative of the isolates in the 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. It is also proposed that Streptomyces cocklensis be transferred to the genus Actinacidiphila as Actinacidiphila cocklensis comb. nov based on its position in the MLSA and phylogenomic trees and associated genomic data. © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Anchialine environments, in which oceanic water mixes with freshwater in coastal aquifers, are characterised by stratified water columns with complex physicochemical profiles. These environments, also known as subterranean estuaries, support an abundance of endemic macro and microorganisms. There is now growing interest in characterising the metabolisms of anchialine microbial communities, which is essential for understanding how complex ecosystems are supported in extreme environments, and assessing their vulnerability to environmental change. However, the diversity of metabolic strategies that are utilised in anchialine ecosystems remains poorly understood. Results: Here, we employ shotgun metagenomics to elucidate the key microorganisms and their dominant metabolisms along a physicochemical profile in Bundera Sinkhole, the only known continental subterranean estuary in the Southern Hemisphere. Genome-resolved metagenomics suggests that the communities are largely represented by novel taxonomic lineages, with 75% of metagenome-assembled genomes assigned to entirely new or uncharacterised families. These diverse and novel taxa displayed depth-dependent metabolisms, reflecting distinct phases along dissolved oxygen and salinity gradients. In particular, the communities appear to drive nutrient feedback loops involving nitrification, nitrate ammonification, and sulphate cycling. Genomic analysis of the most highly abundant members in this system suggests that an important source of chemotrophic energy is generated via the metabolic coupling of nitrogen and sulphur cycling. Conclusion: These findings substantially contribute to our understanding of the novel and specialised microbial communities in anchialine ecosystems, and highlight key chemosynthetic pathways that appear to be important in these energy-limited environments. Such knowledge is essential for the conservation of anchialine ecosystems, and sheds light on adaptive processes in extreme environments.

	abstract = {Extracellular electron transfer (EET) by electroactive bacteria in anoxic soils and sediments is an intensively researched subject, but EET's function in planktonic ecology has been less considered. Following the discovery of an unexpectedly high prevalence of EET genes in a bog lake's bacterioplankton, we hypothesized that the redox capacities of dissolved organic matter (DOM) enrich for electroactive bacteria by mediating redox chemistry. We developed the bioinformatics pipeline FEET (Find EET) to identify and summarize predicted EET protein-encoding genes from metagenomics data. We then applied FEET to 36 bog and thermokarst lakes and correlated gene occurrence with environmental data to test our predictions. Our results provide indirect evidence that DOM may participate in bacterioplankton EET. We found a similarly high prevalence of genes encoding putative EET proteins in most of these lakes, where oxidative EET strongly correlated with DOM. Numerous novel clusters of multiheme cytochromes that may enable EET were identified. Taxa previously not considered EET-capable were found to carry EET genes. We propose that EET and DOM interactions are of ecologically important to bacterioplankton in small boreal lakes, and that EET, particularly by methylotrophs and anoxygenic phototrophs, should be further studied and incorporated into methane emission models of melting permafrost. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are relevant agents in bacterial adaptation and evolutionary diversification. Stable appropriation of these DNA elements depends on host factors, among which are the nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). NAPs are highly abundant proteins that bind and bend DNA, altering its topology and folding, thus affecting all known cellular DNA processes from replication to expression. Even though NAP coding genes are found in most prokaryotic genomes, their functions in host chromosome biology and xenogeneic silencing are only known for a few NAP families. Less is known about the occurrence, abundance, and roles of MGE-encoded NAPs in foreign elements establishment and mobility. In this study, we used a combination of comparative genomics and phylogenetic strategies to gain insights into the diversity, distribution, and functional roles of NAPs within the class Acidithiobacillia with a special focus on their role in MGE biology. Acidithiobacillia class members are aerobic, chemolithoautotrophic, acidophilic sulfur-oxidizers, encompassing substantial genotypic diversity attributable to MGEs. Our search for NAP protein families (PFs) in more than 90 genomes of the different species that conform the class, revealed the presence of 1,197 proteins pertaining to 12 different NAP families, with differential occurrence and conservation across species. Pangenome-level analysis revealed 6 core NAP PFs that were highly conserved across the class, some of which also existed as variant forms of scattered occurrence, in addition to NAPs of taxa-restricted distribution. Core NAPs identified are reckoned as essential based on the conservation of genomic context and phylogenetic signals. In turn, various highly diversified NAPs pertaining to the flexible gene complement of the class, were found to be encoded in known plasmids or, larger integrated MGEs or, present in genomic loci associated with MGE-hallmark genes, pointing to their role in the stabilization/maintenance of these elements in strains and species with larger genomes. Both core and flexible NAPs identified proved valuable as markers, the former accurately recapitulating the phylogeny of the class, and the later, as seed in the bioinformatic identification of novel episomal and integrated mobile elements.

	abstract = {Salt pans or playas, which are saline-rich springs surrounded by halite evaporates in arid environments, have played an essential role in landscape erosion during the formation of the Namib Desert and are numerous in its central region. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomics to investigate the phylogenetic and functional capacities of the microbial communities from two salt pans (namely, Eisefeld and Hosabes) located in central Namib Desert, located in Southwest Africa. We studied the source and sink sediment mat communities of the saline streams, as well as those from two halites (crystallized structures on the stream margins). The microbial assemblages and potential functions were distinct in both niches. Independently from their localization (Eisfeld vs Hosabes and source vs sink), the sediment mat communities were dominated by members of the Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria classes, while halites were Archaea dominated and also contained high abundances of the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter sp. (phylum Bacteroidota). Photoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy were the principal lifestyles in both niches, with halite communities having a reduced diversity of metabolic pathways. Intense microbial-virus interactions in both niches were implied by the widespread detection of CRISPR-Cas defense systems. We identified a putatively novel clade of type II CRISPR-Cas systems, as well as novel candidate viral lineages of the class Caudoviricetes and of Halobacteriales-infecting haloviruses. Putative gene transfer agent-like sequences within the Alphaproteobacteria were identified in the sediment mat communities. These horizontal gene transfer elements have the potential to drive genome plasticity and evolution of the Alphaproteobacteria in the Namib Desert salt pan microbiomes.

	abstract = {Introduction: Rhizosphere microorganisms can effectively promote the stress resistance of plants, and some beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms can significantly promote the growth of crops under salt stress, which has the potential to develop special microbial fertilizers for increasing the yield of saline-alkali land and provides a low-cost and environmentally friendly new strategy for improving the crop yield of saline-alkali cultivated land by using agricultural microbial technology. Methods: In May 2022, a field study in a completely randomized block design was conducted at the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences to explore the correlation between plant rhizosphere microorganisms and soybean growth in saline-alkali soil. Two soybean cultivars (Hening 531, a salt-tolerant variety, and 20_1846, a salt-sensitive variety) were planted at two experimental sites [Daqing (normal condition) and Harbin (saline-alkali conditions)], aiming to investigate the performance of soybean in saline-alkali environments. Results: Soybeans grown in saline-alkali soil showed substantial reductions in key traits: plant height (25%), pod number (26.6%), seed yield (33%), and 100 seed weight (13%). This underscores the unsuitability of this soil type for soybean cultivation. Additionally, microbial analysis revealed 43 depleted and 56 enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the saline-alkali soil compared to normal soil. Furthermore, an analysis of ion-associated microbes identified 85 mOTUs with significant correlations with various ions. A co-occurrence network analysis revealed strong relationships between specific mOTUs and ions, such as Proteobacteria with multiple ions. In addition, the study investigated the differences in rhizosphere species between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive soybean varieties under saline-alkali soil conditions. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that mOTUs in saline-alkali soil were associated with pH and ions, while mOTUs in normal soil were correlated with Ca2+ and K+. Comparative analyses identified significant differences in mOTUs between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive varieties under both saline-alkali and normal soil conditions. Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were dominant in the bacterial community of saline-alkali soil, with significant enrichment compared to normal soil. The study explored the functioning of the soybean rhizosphere key microbiome by comparing metagenomic data to four databases related to the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles. A total of 141 KOs (KEGG orthologues) were identified, with 66 KOs related to the carbon cycle, 16 KOs related to the nitrogen cycle, 48 KOs associated with the phosphorus cycle, and 11 KOs linked to the sulfur cycle. Significant correlations were found between specific mOTUs, functional genes, and phenotypic traits, including per mu yield (PMY), grain weight, and effective pod number per plant. Conclusion: Overall, this study provides comprehensive insights into the structure, function, and salt-related species of soil microorganisms in saline-alkali soil and their associations with salt tolerance and soybean phenotype. The identification of key microbial species and functional categories offers valuable information for understanding the mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions in challenging soil conditions.

	abstract = {Movile Cave, situated in Romania close to the Black Sea, constitutes a distinct and challenging environment for life. Its partially submerged ecosystem depends on chemolithotrophic processes for its energetics, which are fed by a continuous hypogenic inflow of mesothermal waters rich in reduced chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide and methane. We sampled a variety of cave sublocations over the course of three years. Furthermore, in a microcosm experiment, minerals were incubated in the cave waters for one year. Both endemic cave samples and extracts from the minerals were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The sequence data show specific community profiles in the different subenvironments, indicating that specialized prokaryotic communities inhabit the different zones in the cave. Already after one year, the different incubated minerals had been colonized by specific microbial communities, indicating that microbes in Movile Cave can adapt in a relatively short timescale to environmental opportunities in terms of energy and nutrients. Life can thrive, diversify and adapt in remote and isolated subterranean environments such as Movile Cave. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A bacterium (named strain LR5S19T) was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of the halophyte Kalidium cuspidatum in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China. Strain LR5S19T was Gram-stain-positive, motile with a polar flagellum, rod shaped, and spore forming at the terminal position in swollen sporangia, and it grew at 10–40 ℃ (optimum 30 ℃), pH 6.0–9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), and in the presence of 1.0–15.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2.0%). The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that strain LR5S19T shared the highest similarity (96.7%) with A. koreensis JCM 12387T, followed by A. kalidii HU2P27T (96.2%), A. sediminis BH258T (96.1%), and ‘A. salsiterrae’ 3ASR75-54T (96.0%). The ANIb, AAI and dDDH values between strain LR5S19T and its closely related type strains were 69.3–73.8%, 65.4–72.4% and 19.2–20.3%, respectively. The major polar lipids in strain LR5S19T consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and three unidentified phospholipids, while MK-7 was the major respiratory quinone. The major fatty acids of the strain were anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0. Based on phylogenomic and phenotypic results, strain LR5S19T should be classified as a novel species within the genus Aquibacillus, for which Aquibacillus rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LR5S19T (= CGMCC 1.62028T = KCTC 43434T). The comparative genomic analysis revealed that all eight members of Aquibacillus could utilize D-glucose via the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis pathway or the pentose phosphate pathway and use the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the metabolic center. The potassium ion transport proteins and compatible solute synthesis pathways in all the members likely also help them cope with hypersaline environments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {We present here a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of Acetobacteraceae, a vast group of alphaproteobacteria that has been widely studied for their economic importance. Our results indicate that the ancestor of Acetobacteraceae most likely was photosynthetic and evolved via a progressive transition from versatile photoferrotrophy to the incomplete oxidation of organic substrates defining acetous physiology. Vestigial signs of photosynthetic carotenoid metabolism are present in non-photosynthetic acetous taxa that have lost cytochrome oxidase, while their sister taxa retain such traits. The dominant terminal oxidase of acetous bacteria, the bo3 ubiquinol oxidase, is derived from duplication and diversification of operons present in Acidocella taxa that have lost photosynthesis. We analyzed the bioenergetic traits that can compensate for the electron transfer function of photosynthetic reaction centers or constitute alternative pathways for the oxidoreduction of c-type cytochromes, such as iron oxidation. The latter pathway bypasses the deranged cytochrome bc1 complex that is characteristically present in acidophilic taxa due to the loss of conserved ligands in both the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b subunit. The deranged or non-functional bc1 complex may be retained for its structural role in stabilizing Complex I. The combination of our phylogenetic analysis with in-depth functional evaluations indicates that the order Acetobacterales needs to be emended to include three families: Acetobacteraceae sensu stricto, Roseomonadaceae fam. nov., and Acidocellaceae fam. nov.

	abstract = {Background: NorQ, a member of the MoxR-class of AAA+ ATPases, and NorD, a protein containing a Von Willebrand Factor Type A (VWA) domain, are essential for non-heme iron (FeB) cofactor insertion into cytochrome c-dependent nitric oxide reductase (cNOR). cNOR catalyzes NO reduction, a key step of bacterial denitrification. This work aimed at elucidating the specific mechanism of NorQD-catalyzed FeB insertion, and the general mechanism of the MoxR/VWA interacting protein families. Results: We show that NorQ-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, an intact VWA domain in NorD, and specific surface carboxylates on cNOR are all features required for cNOR activation. Supported by BN-PAGE, low-resolution cryo-EM structures of NorQ and the NorQD complex show that NorQ forms a circular hexamer with a monomer of NorD binding both to the side and to the central pore of the NorQ ring. Guided by AlphaFold predictions, we assign the density that “plugs” the NorQ ring pore to the VWA domain of NorD with a protruding “finger” inserting through the pore and suggest this binding mode to be general for MoxR/VWA couples. Conclusions: Based on our results, we present a tentative model for the mechanism of NorQD-catalyzed cNOR remodeling and suggest many of its features to be applicable to the whole MoxR/VWA family. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Biogeochemical sulfur cycling in sulfidic karst systems is largely driven by abiotic and biological sulfide oxidation, but the fate of elemental sulfur (S0) that accumulates in these systems is not well understood. The Frasassi Cave system (Italy) is intersected by a sulfidic aquifer that mixes with small quantities of oxygen-rich meteoric water, creating Proterozoic-like conditions and supporting a prolific ecosystem driven by sulfur-based chemolithoautotrophy. To better understand the cycling of S0 in this environment, we examined the geochemistry and microbiology of sediments underlying widespread sulfide-oxidizing mats dominated by Beggiatoa. Sediment populations were dominated by uncultivated relatives of sulfur cycling chemolithoautotrophs related to Sulfurovum, Halothiobacillus, Thiofaba, Thiovirga, Thiobacillus, and Desulfocapsa, as well as diverse uncultivated anaerobic heterotrophs affiliated with Bacteroidota, Anaerolineaceae, Lentimicrobiaceae, and Prolixibacteraceae. Desulfocapsa and Sulfurovum populations accounted for 12%–26% of sediment 16S rRNA amplicon sequences and were closely related to isolates which carry out autotrophic S0 disproportionation in pure culture. Gibbs energy (∆Gr) calculations revealed that S0 disproportionation under in situ conditions is energy yielding. Microsensor profiles through the mat-sediment interface showed that Beggiatoa mats consume dissolved sulfide and oxygen, but a net increase in acidity was only observed in the sediments below. Together, these findings suggest that disproportionation is an important sink for S0 generated by microbial sulfide oxidation in this oxygen-limited system and may contribute to the weathering of carbonate rocks and sediments in sulfur-rich environments. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Numerous studies in the past have expanded our understanding of the genetic differences of global distributed cyanobacteria that originated around billions of years ago, however, unraveling how gene gain and loss drive the genetic evolution of cyanobacterial species, and the trade-off of these evolutionary forces are still the central but poorly understood issues. Results: To delineate the contribution of gene flow in mediating the hereditary differentiation and shaping the microbial evolution, a global genome-wide study of bloom-forming cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa species complex, provided robust evidence for genetic diversity, reflected by enormous variation in gene repertoire among various strains. Mathematical extrapolation showed an ‘open’ microbial pan-genome of M. aeruginosa species, since novel genes were predicted to be introduced after new genomes were sequenced. Identification of numerous horizontal gene transfer’s signatures in genome regions of interest suggested that genome expansion via transformation and phage-mediated transduction across bacterial lineage as an evolutionary route may contribute to the differentiation of Microcystis functions (e.g., carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism). Meanwhile, the selective loss of some dispensable genes at the cost of metabolic versatility is as a mean of adaptive evolution that has the potential to increase the biological fitness. Conclusions: Now that the recruitment of novel genes was accompanied by a parallel loss of some other ones, a trade-off in gene content may drive the divergent differentiation of M. aeruginosa genomes. Our study provides a genetic framework for the evolution of M. aeruginosa species and illustrates their possible evolutionary patterns. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

With the increasing shortage in LIB raw materials, the recycling of spent LIBs has become a fundamental part of a sustainable approach for energy storage applications, considering the potential economic and environmental benefits. In this mini-review, we will provide a state-of-the-art overview of LIB recycling processes (e.g., echelon utilization, pretreatment, valuable metal leaching and separation). We then discuss the sustainability of current LIB recycling processes from the perspectives of life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic feasibility. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges and possibilities of LIB recycling processes and provide future directions that can bridge the gap between proof-of-concept bench demonstrations and facility-scale field deployments through mutual efforts from academia, industry, and government. It is expected that this review could provide a guideline for enhancing spent LIB recycling and facilitating the sustainable development of the field. © 2022},

	abstract = {The recent revision of the Acidithiobacillia class using genomic taxonomy methods has shown that, in addition to the existence of previously unrecognized genera and species, some species of the class harbor levels of divergence that are congruent with ongoing differentiation processes. In this study, we have performed a subspecies-level analysis of sequenced strains of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans to prove the existence of distinct sublineages and identify the discriminant genomic/genetic characteristics linked to these sublineages, and to shed light on the processes driving such differentiation. Differences in the genomic relatedness metrics, levels of synteny, gene content, and both integrated and episomal mobile genetic elements (MGE) repertoires support the existence of two subspecies-level taxa within A. ferrooxidans. While sublineage 2A harbors a small plasmid related to pTF5, this episomal MGE is absent in sublineage 2B strains. Likewise, clear differences in the occurrence, coverage and conservation of integrated MGEs are apparent between sublineages. Differential MGE-associated gene cargo pertained to the functional categories of energy metabolism, ion transport, cell surface modification, and defense mechanisms. Inferred functional differences have the potential to impact long-term adaptive processes and may underpin the basis of the subspecies-level differentiation uncovered within A. ferrooxidans. Genome resequencing of iron- and sulfur-adapted cultures of a selected 2A sublineage strain (CCM 4253) showed that both episomal and large integrated MGEs are conserved over twenty generations in either growth condition. In turn, active insertion sequences profoundly impact short-term adaptive processes. The ISAfe1 element was found to be highly active in sublineage 2A strain CCM 4253. Phenotypic mutations caused by the transposition of ISAfe1 into the pstC2 encoding phosphate-transport system permease protein were detected in sulfur-adapted cultures and shown to impair growth on ferrous iron upon the switch of electron donor. The phenotypic manifestation of the △pstC2 mutation, such as a loss of the ability to oxidize ferrous iron, is likely related to the inability of the mutant to secure the phosphorous availability for electron transport-linked phosphorylation coupled to iron oxidation. Depletion of the transpositional △pstC2 mutation occurred concomitantly with a shortening of the iron-oxidation lag phase at later transfers on a ferrous iron-containing medium. Therefore, the pstII operon appears to play an essential role in A. ferrooxidans when cells oxidize ferrous iron. Results highlight the influence of insertion sequences and both integrated and episomal mobile genetic elements in the short- and long-term adaptive processes of A. ferrooxidans strains under changing growth conditions. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Microorganism-mediated biohydrometallurgy, a sustainable approach for metal recovery from ores, relies on the metabolic activity of acidophilic bacteria. Acidithiobacillia with sulfur/iron-oxidizing capacities are extensively studied and applied in biohydrometallurgy-related processes. However, only 14 distinct proteins from Acidithiobacillia have experimentally determined structures currently available. This significantly hampers in-depth investigations of Acidithiobacillia’s structure-based biological mechanisms pertaining to its relevant biohydrometallurgical processes. To address this issue, we employed a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach, with a median model confidence of 0.80, to perform high-quality full-chain structure predictions on the pan-proteome (10,458 proteins) of the type strain Acidithiobacillia. Additionally, we conducted various case studies on de novo protein structural prediction, including sulfate transporter and iron oxidase, to demonstrate how accurate structure predictions and gene co-occurrence networks can contribute to the development of mechanistic insights and hypotheses regarding sulfur and iron utilization proteins. Furthermore, for the unannotated proteins that constitute 35.8% of the Acidithiobacillia proteome, we employed the deep-learning algorithm DeepFRI to make structure-based functional predictions. As a result, we successfully obtained gene ontology (GO) terms for 93.6% of these previously unknown proteins. This study has a significant impact on improving protein structure and function predictions, as well as developing state-of-the-art techniques for high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data.

	abstract = {The uranium inventory in the Boeun aquifer is situated near an artificial reservoir (40–70 m apart) intended to supply water to nearby cities. However, toxic radionuclides can enter the reservoir. To determine the U mobility in the system, we analyzed groundwater and fracture-filling materials (FFMs) for environmental tracers, including microbial signatures, redox-sensitive elements and isotopes. In the site, U mass flux ranged from only 9.59 × 10–7 µg/L/y to 1.70 × 10–4 µg/L/y. The δ18O-H2O and 14C signatures showed that groundwater originated mainly from upland recharges and was not influenced by oxic surface water. We observed U accumulations (∼157 mg/kg) in shallow FFMs and Fe enrichments (∼226798 mg/kg) and anomalies in the 230Th/238U activity ratio (AR), 230Th/234U AR, δ56Fe and δ57Fe isotopes, suggesting that low U mobility in shallow depths is associated with a Fe-rich environment. At shallow depths, anaerobic Fe-oxidizers, Gallionella was prevalent in the groundwater, while Acidovorax was abundant near the U ore deposit depth. The Fe-rich environment at shallow depths was formed by sulfide dissolution, as demonstrated by δ34S-SO4 and δ18O-SO4 distribution. Overall, the Fe-rich aquifer including abundant sulfide minerals immobilizes dissolved U through biotic and abiotic processes, without significant leaching into nearby reservoirs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Operations in copper sulfide flotation plants (CSFP) are complex and governed by several variables such as available technologies, reagents, and environmental conditions. However, few investigations are related to studying the microbial communities. These aspects provide a reason to compare the bacterial communities of two CSFP operated with freshwater (FwFlo) and seawater (SwFlo), and study whether indigenous bacteria could be used as pyrite bioreagents. Analyses were determined through next-generation sequencing by Illumina MiSeq System and conducted throughout the entire process: (i) minerals before and after grinding; (ii) final concentrate and concentrate thickener overflow; (iii) final tailings and tailings thickener overflow; and (iv) intake water. Bacterial strains from both plants were tested as potential bioreagents, given their tendency to adhere to pyrite after 5 min. In both CSFP, Proteobacteria (relative abundance from 45.48% to 79.22%), followed by Bacteroidetes (9.37%–44.7%), were the most abundant phyla. Regarding species, Algoriphagus olei (11.35%–43.52%) was present exclusively in FwFlo samples in contact with process water and absent in the mineral before grinding, where Cupriavidus metallidurans (16.05%) and Pseudomonas_uc (11.79%) predominated. In SwFlo samples, Marinobacter flavimaris (3.47%–41.1%), and GU061212-s (10.92%–27.63%), were the most abundant microorganisms. All of them were also detected in intake seawater. The strains with the highest adhesion rate (from 29.84% ± 0.14–100%) were phylogenetically identified as species of the genera Marinobacter, Pseudomonas, Idiomarina, Halomonas, Bacillus, Aerocuccus, and Peribacillus. Our results reveal that bacterial communities are critically dependent on process waters during mining activities, and our data depicted that indigenous bacteria could be used as potential pyrite bioreagents, evidenced by a high adhesion rate. It is thus possible to propose that different indigenous bacterial strains could be considered as new bioreagents to reduce the impact of conventional flotation reagents on health from an environment friendly perspective. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A new strain of Leptospirillum sp. Ksh-L was isolated from a dump-bioleaching system of the Kashen copper-molybdenum mine (South Caucasus). Ksh-L is an obligate chemolithoautotroph, capable of oxidizing ferrous iron (Fe2+). Cells are Gram-negative and vibrio- or spirillum-shaped of a 0.5–3 µm size. The optimal conditions for the growth are 35 °C and pH 1.6–1.8. Cu2+ and Zn2+ have different effects on the oxidizing ability of the Leptospirillum sp. Ksh-L culture depending on the phase of growth and concentration of Fe2+. Under the conditions of gradually increasing the concentration of copper in the medium, during 4–5 successive subculturing experiments, it was possible to obtain an adapted culture of Leptospirillum sp. Ksh-L, capable of growing in the medium in the presence of up to 400 mM Cu2+. A bioleaching experiment indicates that Ksh-L can efficiently oxidize chalcopyrite. However, the bioleaching of copper from chalcopyrite by Leptospirillum ferrodiazotropum Ksh-L increased about 1.8 times in association with At. thiooxidans ATCC 19377. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (GenBank ID ON226845) shows that strain Ksh-L forms a single cluster into Group III. The strain possesses 99.59%, 99.52%, and 96.60% sequence similarity with the strains YTW-96-06, YTW-66-06, and Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum 5C in Group III, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Gut microbial imbalances are linked to colorectal cancer (CRC), but archaea’s role remains underexplored. Here, using previously published metagenomic data from different populations including Austria, Germany, Italy, Japan, China, and India, we performed bioinformatic and statistical analysis to identify archaeal taxonomic and functional signatures related to CRC. Methods: We analyzed published fecal metagenomic data from 390 subjects, comparing the archaeomes of CRC and healthy individuals. We conducted a biostatistical analysis to investigate the relationship between Candidatus Mancarchaeum acidiphilum (DPANN superphylum) and other archaeal species associated with CRC. Using the Prokka tool, we annotated the data focusing on archaeal genes, subsequently linking them to CRC and mapping them against UniprotKB and GO databases for specific archaeal gene functions. Results: Our analysis identified enrichment of methanogenic archaea in healthy subjects, with an exception for Methanobrevibacter smithii, which correlated with CRC. Notably, CRC showed a strong association with archaeal species, particularly Natrinema sp. J7-2, Ferroglobus placidus, and Candidatus Mancarchaeum acidiphilum. Furthermore, the DPANN archaeon exhibited a significant correlation with other CRC-associated archaea (p < 0.001). Functionally, we found a marked association between MvhB-type polyferredoxin and colorectal cancer. We also highlighted the association of archaeal proteins involved in the biosynthesis of leucine and the galactose metabolism process with the healthy phenotype. Conclusions: The archaeomes of CRC patients show identifiable alterations, including a decline in methanogens and an increase in Halobacteria species.

	abstract = {Lake Caviahue (37° 50 ‘S and 71° 06’ W; Patagonia, Argentina) is an extreme case of a glacial, naturally acidic, aquatic environment (pH ~ 3). Knowledge of the bacterial communities in the water column of this lake, is incipient, with a basal quantification of the bacterioplankton abundance distribution in the North and South Basins of Lake Caviahue, and the described the presence of sulfur and iron oxidizing bacteria in the lake sediments. The role that bacterioplankton plays in nutrient utilization and recycling in this environment, especially in the phosphorus cycle, has not been studied. In this work, we explore this aspect in further depth by assessing the diversity of pelagic, littoral and sediment bacteria, using state of the art molecular methods and identifying the differences and commonalties in the composition of the cognate communities. Also, we investigate the interactions between the sediments of Lake Caviahue and the microbial communities present in both sediments, pore water and the water column, to comprehend the ecological relationships driving nutrient structure and fluxes, with a special focus on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Two major environmental patterns were observed: (a) one distinguishing the surface water samples due to temperature, Fe2+, and electrical conductivity, and (b) another distinguishing winter and summer samples due to the high pH and increasing concentrations of N-NH4+, DOC and SO42−, from autumn and spring samples with high soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and iron concentrations. The largest bacterial abundance was found in autumn, alongside higher levels of dissolved phosphorus, iron forms, and increased conductivity. The highest values of bacterial biomass were found in the bottom strata of the lake, which is also where the greatest diversity in microbial communities was found. The experiments using continuous flow column microcosms showed that microbial growth over time, in both the test and control columns, was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of dissolved nutrients (SRP and N-NH4+), providing proof that sediment microorganisms are active and contribute significantly to nutrient utilization/mobilization.

	abstract = {The oil sands mining operations in Alberta have produced billions of m3 of tailings which must be reclaimed and integrated into various mine closure landforms, including terrestrial landforms. Microorganisms play a central role in nutrient cycling during the reclamation of disturbed landscapes, contributing to successful vegetation restoration and long-term sustainability. However, microbial community succession and response in reconstructed and revegetated tailings remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to monitor the structural and functional responses of microbial communities in tailings subjected to different capping and vegetation strategies over two growing seasons (GS). To achieve this, a column-based greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate microbial communities in tailings that were capped with a layer (10 or 30 cm) of peat-mineral mix (PMM) and planted with either upland or wetland communities. DNA metabarcoding analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS2 region as well as shotgun metagenomics were used to asses the impact of treatments on microbial taxonomy and functions, respectively. Results showed that tailings microbial diversity and community composition changed considerably after two GS compared to baseline samples, while communities in the PMM capping layer were much more stable. Likewise, several microbial functions were significantly enriched in tailings after two GS. Interestingly, the impact of capping on bacterial communities in tailings varied depending on the plant community, leading to a higher number of differentially abundant taxa and to a decrease in Shannon diversity and evenness in the upland treatment but not in the wetland treatment. Moreover, while capping in the presence of wetland vegetation increased the energy-related metabolic functions (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur), these functions were depleted by capping in the upland treatment. Fungi represented a small proportion of the microbial community in tailings, but the relative abundance of several taxa changed over time, while the capping treatments favored the growth of some beneficial taxa, notably the root endophyte Serendipita, in both upland and wetland columns. The results suggest that selecting the right combination of capping material and vegetation type may contribute to improve below-ground microbial processes and sustain plant growth in harsh environments such as oil sands tailings.

	abstract = {Thiotrophic symbioses between sulphur-oxidizing bacteria and various unicellular and metazoan eukaryotes are widespread in reducing marine environments. The giant colonial ciliate Zoothamnium niveum, however, is the only host of thioautotrophic symbionts that has been cultivated along with its symbiont, the vertically transmitted ectosymbiont Candidatus Thiobius zoothamnicola (short Thiobius). Because theoretical predictions posit a smaller genome in vertically transmitted endosymbionts compared to free-living relatives, we investigated whether this is true also for an ectosymbiont. We used metagenomics to recover the high-quality draft genome of this bacterial symbiont. For comparison we have also sequenced a closely related free-living cultured but not formally described strain Milos ODIII6 (short ODIII6). We then performed comparative genomics to assess the functional capabilities at gene, metabolic pathway and trait level. 16S rRNA gene trees and average amino acid identity confirmed the close phylogenetic relationship of both bacteria. Indeed, Thiobius has about a third smaller genome than its free-living relative ODIII6, with reduced metabolic capabilities and fewer functional traits. The functional capabilities of Thiobius were a subset of those of the more versatile ODIII6, which possessed additional genes for oxygen, sulphur and hydrogen utilization and for the acquisition of phosphorus illustrating features that may be adaptive for the unstable environmental conditions at hydrothermal vents. In contrast, Thiobius possesses genes potentially enabling it to utilize lactate and acetate heterotrophically, compounds that may be provided as byproducts by the host. The present study illustrates the effect of strict host-dependence of a bacterial ectosymbiont on genome evolution and host adaptation. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Bacterial carbonic anhydrases (BCAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are indispensable enzymes in microbial physiology because they facilitate the hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2) to bicarbonate ions (HCO3−) and protons (H+), which are crucial for various metabolic processes and cellular homeostasis. Their involvement spans from metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis, respiration, to organic compounds production, which are pivotal for bacterial growth and survival. This chapter elucidates the diversity of BCA genetic families, categorized into four distinct classes (α, β, γ, and ι), which may reflect bacterial adaptation to environmental niches and their metabolic demands. The diversity of BCAs is essential not only for understanding their physiological roles but also for exploring their potential in biotechnology. Knowledge of their diversity enables researchers to develop innovative biocatalysts for industrial applications, including carbon capture technologies to convert CO2 emissions into valuable products. Additionally, BCAs are relevant to biomedical research and drug development because of their involvement in bacterial pathogenesis and microbial survival within the host. Understanding the diversity and function of BCAs can aid in designing targeted therapeutics that interfere with bacterial metabolism and potentially reduce the risk of infections. © 2024},

	abstract = {The iron-oxidizing Gallionellaceae drive a wide variety of biogeochemical cycles through their metabolisms and biominerals. To better understand the environmental impacts of Gallionellaceae, we need to improve our knowledge of their diversity and metabolisms, especially any novel iron oxidation mechanisms. Here, we used a pangenomic analysis of 103 genomes to resolve Gallionellaceae phylogeny and explore their genomic potential. Using a concatenated ribosomal protein tree and key gene patterns, we determined Gallionellaceae has four genera, divided into two groups: iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) Gallionella, Sideroxydans, and Ferriphaselus with iron oxidation genes (cyc2, mtoA) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) Candidatus Nitrotoga with the nitrite oxidase gene nxr. The FeOB and NOB have similar electron transport chains, including genes for reverse electron transport and carbon fixation. Auxiliary energy metabolisms, including S oxidation, denitrification, and organotrophy, were scattered throughout the FeOB. Within FeOB, we found genes that may represent adaptations for iron oxidation, including a variety of extracellular electron uptake mechanisms. FeOB genomes encoded more predicted c-type cytochromes than NOB genomes, notably more multiheme c-type cytochromes (MHCs) with >10 CXXCH motifs. These include homologs of several predicted outer membrane porin-MHC complexes, including MtoAB and Uet. MHCs efficiently conduct electrons across longer distances and function across a wide range of redox potentials that overlap with mineral redox potentials, which can expand the range of usable iron substrates. Overall, the results of pangenome analyses suggest that the Gallionellaceae genera Gallionella, Sideroxydans, and Ferriphaselus have acquired a range of adaptations to succeed in various environments but are primarily iron oxidizers.

	abstract = {Acidophilic bacteria and archaea inhabit extreme geochemical “islands” that can tell us when and how geographic barriers affect the biogeography of microorganisms. Here, we describe microbial communities from extremely acidic (pH 0 to 1) biofilms, known as snottites, from hydrogen sulfide-rich caves. Given the extreme acidity and subsurface location of these biofilms, and in light of earlier work showing strong geographic patterns among snottite Acidithiobacillus populations, we investigated their structure and diversity in order to understand how geography might impact community assembly. We used 16S rRNA gene cloning and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to investigate 26 snottite samples from four sulfidic caves in Italy and Mexico. All samples had very low biodiversity and were dominated by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in the genus Acidithiobacillus. Ferroplasma and other archaea in the Thermoplasmatales ranged from 0 to 50% of total cells, and relatives of the bacterial genera Acidimicrobium and Ferrimicrobium were up to 15% of total cells. Rare phylotypes included Sulfobacillus spp. and members of the phyla “Candidatus Dependentiae” and “Candidatus Saccharibacteria” (formerly TM6 and TM7). Although the same genera of acidophiles occurred in snottites on separate continents, most members of those genera represent substantially divergent populations, with 16S rRNA genes that are only 95 to 98% similar. Our findings are consistent with a model of community assembly where sulfidic caves are stochastically colonized by microorganisms from local sources, which are strongly filtered through environmental selection for extreme acid tolerance, and these different colonization histories are maintained by dispersal restrictions within and among caves. © 2023 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {In the present study, the effect of additional carbon sources (carbon dioxide and molasses) on the bio-oxidation of a pyrite–arsenopyrite concentrate at temperatures of 40–50 °C was studied, and novel data regarding the patterns of the bio-oxidation of gold-bearing sulfide concentrates and the composition of the microbial populations performing these processes were obtained. At 40 °C, additional carbon sources did not affect the bio-oxidation efficiency. At the same time, the application of additional carbon dioxide improved the bio-oxidation performance at temperatures of 45 and 50 °C and made it possible to avoid the inhibition of bio-oxidation due to an increase in the temperature. Therefore, the use of additional carbon dioxide may be proposed to prevent the negative effect of an increase in temperature on the bio-oxidation of sulfide concentrates. 16S rRNA gene profiling revealed archaea of the family Thermoplasmataceae (Acidiplasma, Ferroplasma, Cuniculiplasma, and A-plasma group) and bacteria of the genera Leptospirillum, with Sulfobacillus and Acidithiobacillus among the dominant groups in the community. Temperature influenced the composition of the communities to a greater extent than the additional sources of carbon and the mode of operation of the bioreactor. Elevating the temperature from 40 °C to 50 °C resulted in increases in the shares of Acidiplasma and Sulfobacillus and decreases in the relative abundances of Ferroplasma, Leptospirillum, and Acidithiobacillus, while Cuniculiplasma and A-plasma were more abundant at 45 °C. A metagenomic analysis of the studied population made it possible to characterize novel archaea belonging to an uncultivated, poorly-studied group of Thermoplasmatales which potentially plays an important role in the bio-oxidation process. Based on an analysis of the complete genome, we propose describing the novel species and novel genus as “Candidatus Carboxiplasma ferriphilum” gen. nov., spec. nov. © 2023 by the authors.},

The physiological characterization of these isolates revealed wide versatility in electron donors (Fe(II) and Mn(II), or thiosulfate) and a variety of lifestyles as lithotrophic or heterotrophic, microaerobic, or anaerobic. As a representative strain, Pseudomonas sp. IOP_13 showed its autotrophic gowth from 105 cells/ml to 107 cells/ml;carbon dioxide fixation capacity with the δ13CVPDB in the biomass increased from −27.42‰ to 3460.06‰; the thiosulfate-oxidizing ability with produced SO42− increased from 60 mg/L to 287 mg/L; and the iron-oxidizing ability with Fe(II) decreased from 10 mM to 5.2 mM. In addition, iron-oxide crust formed outside the cells. Gene coding for energy metabolism involved in possible iron, manganese, and sulfur oxidation, and denitrification was identified by their genome analysis. This study sheds light on the function of the mixotrophic microbial community in the iron/manganese/sulfur cycles and the carbon fixation of the hydrothermal fields. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms that exhibit resistance to environmental stressors, particularly heavy metals, have the potential to be used in bioremediation strategies. This study aimed to explore and identify microorganisms that are resistant to heavy metals in soil environments as potential candidates for bioremediation. Metagenomic analysis was conducted using microbiome metagenomes obtained from the rhizosphere of soil contaminated with heavy metals and mineral-affected soil. The analysis resulted in the recovery of a total of 175 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), 73 of which were potentially representing novel taxonomic levels beyond the genus level. The constructed ecological network revealed the presence of keystone taxa, including Rhizobiaceae, Xanthobacteraceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Actinomycetia. Among the recovered MAGs, 50 were associated with these keystone taxa. Notably, these MAGs displayed an abundance of genes conferring resistance to heavy metals and other abiotic stresses, particularly those affiliated with the keystone taxa. These genes were found to combat excessive accumulation of zinc/manganese, arsenate/arsenite, chromate, nickel/cobalt, copper, and tellurite. Furthermore, the keystone taxa were found to utilize both organic and inorganic energy sources, such as sulfur, arsenic, and carbon dioxide. Additionally, these keystone taxa exhibited the ability to promote vegetation development in re-vegetated mining areas through phosphorus solubilization and metabolite secretion. In summary, our study highlights the metabolic adaptability and ecological significance of microbial keystone taxa in mineral-affected soils. The MAGs associated with keystone taxa exhibited a markedly higher number of genes related to abiotic stress resistance and plant growth promotion compared to non-keystone taxa MAGs.

	abstract = {Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen consisting of three phylogroups (hereafter named A, B, and C). Here, we assessed phylogroup-specific evolutionary dynamics across available and also new P. aeruginosa genomes. Methods: In this genomic analysis, we first generated new genome assemblies for 18 strains of the major P. aeruginosa clone type (mPact) panel, comprising a phylogenetically diverse collection of clinical and environmental isolates for this species. Thereafter, we combined these new genomes with 1991 publicly available P. aeruginosa genomes for a phylogenomic and comparative analysis. We specifically explored to what extent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, defence systems, and virulence genes vary in their distribution across regions of genome plasticity (RGPs) and “masked” (RGP-free) genomes, and to what extent this variation differs among the phylogroups. Findings: We found that members of phylogroup B possess larger genomes, contribute a comparatively larger number of pangenome families, and show lower abundance of CRISPR-Cas systems. Furthermore, AMR and defence systems are pervasive in RGPs and integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements (ICEs/IMEs) from phylogroups A and B, and the abundance of these cargo genes is often significantly correlated. Moreover, inter- and intra-phylogroup interactions occur at the accessory genome level, suggesting frequent recombination events. Finally, we provide here the mPact panel of diverse P. aeruginosa strains that may serve as a valuable reference for functional analyses. Interpretation: Altogether, our results highlight distinct pangenome characteristics of the P. aeruginosa phylogroups, which are possibly influenced by variation in the abundance of CRISPR-Cas systems and are shaped by the differential distribution of other defence systems and AMR genes.

	abstract = {Background: Gypsum Hill Spring, located in Nunavut in the Canadian High Arctic, is a rare example of a cold saline spring arising through thick permafrost. It perennially discharges cold (~ 7 °C), hypersaline (7–8% salinity), anoxic (~ 0.04 ppm O2), and highly reducing (~ − 430 mV) brines rich in sulfate (2.2 g.L−1) and sulfide (9.5 ppm), making Gypsum Hill an analog to putative sulfate-rich briny habitats on extraterrestrial bodies such as Mars. Results: Genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were utilized to describe an active microbial community containing novel metagenome-assembled genomes and dominated by sulfur-cycling Desulfobacterota and Gammaproteobacteria. Sulfate reduction was dominated by hydrogen-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic Desulfovibrionaceae sp. and was identified in phyla not typically associated with sulfate reduction in novel lineages of Spirochaetota and Bacteroidota. Highly abundant and active sulfur-reducing Desulfuromusa sp. highly transcribed non-coding RNAs associated with transcriptional regulation, showing potential evidence of putative metabolic flexibility in response to substrate availability. Despite low oxygen availability, sulfide oxidation was primarily attributed to aerobic chemolithoautotrophic Halothiobacillaceae. Low abundance and transcription of photoautotrophs indicated sulfur-based chemolithoautotrophy drives primary productivity even during periods of constant illumination. Conclusions: We identified a rare surficial chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-cycling microbial community active in a unique anoxic, cold, hypersaline Arctic spring. We detected Mars-relevant metabolisms including hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction, sulfur reduction, and sulfide oxidation, which indicate the potential for microbial life in analogous S-rich brines on past and present Mars.

On the contrary, exploiting the inherent genes and mechanisms of halotolerant bacteria can bring revolution in agriculture. Present study was designed to characterize ATPase dependent protein complexes kdpFABC and kdpDE in a salt tolerant bacterium Alcaligenes xylosoxydans. This complex enables plants to endure the saline environmental conditions through enhancing the K+ ions influx. For characterization, protein sequences of three isoforms of kdpA, four of kdpB, two of kdpC and one of kdpE were retrieved from Uniprot database. These were analyzed via ProtParam tool, AlphaFold protein database and HDOCK server. Highest affinity for ATP molecule was observed in kdpB confirming its reported function of ATP hydrolysis. All documented proteins were found polar (except kdpE), alkaline (except one isoform of each kdpA and kdpB), thermostable, to exhibit complex 3D structure (except for kdpC and E) and in vitro stability. These properties of subunit proteins can be exploited to engineer the complex and produce osmotolerant transgenic plants. © 2023 EScience Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria play a crucial role in various processes, including mine bioleaching, biodesulfurization, and treatment of sulfur-containing wastewater. Nevertheless, the pathway involved in sulfur oxidation is highly intricate, making it complete comprehension a formidable and protracted undertaking. The mechanisms of sulfur oxidation within the Acidithiobacillus genus, along with the process of energy production, remain areas that necessitate further research and elucidation. In this study, a novel strain of sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, Acidithiobacillus Ameehan, was isolated. Several physiological characteristics of the strain Ameehan were verified and its complete genome sequence was presented in the study. Besides, the first genome-scale metabolic network model (AMEE_WP1377) was reconstructed for Acidithiobacillus Ameehan to gain a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic capacity of the strain.The characteristics of Acidithiobacillus Ameehan included morphological size and an optimal growth temperature range of 37-45°C, as well as an optimal growth pH range of pH 2.0-8.0. The microbe was found to be capable of growth when sulfur and K2O6S4 were supplied as the energy source and electron donor for CO2 fixation. Conversely, it could not utilize Na2S2O3, FeS2, and FeSO4·7H2O as the energy source or electron donor for CO2 fixation, nor could it grow using glucose or yeast extract as a carbon source. Genome annotation revealed that the strain Ameehan possessed a series of sulfur oxidizing genes that enabled it to oxidize elemental sulfur or various reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs). In addition, the bacterium also possessed carbon fixing genes involved in the incomplete Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. However, the bacterium lacked the ability to oxidize iron and fix nitrogen. By implementing a constraint-based flux analysis to predict cellular growth in the presence of 71 carbon sources, 88.7% agreement with experimental Biolog data was observed. Five sulfur oxidation pathways were discovered through model simulations. The optimal sulfur oxidation pathway had the highest ATP production rate of 14.81 mmol/gDW/h, NADH/NADPH production rate of 5.76 mmol/gDW/h, consumed 1.575 mmol/gDW/h of CO2, and 1.5 mmol/gDW/h of sulfur. Our findings provide a comprehensive outlook on the most effective cellular metabolic pathways implicated in sulfur oxidation within Acidithiobacillus Ameehan. It suggests that the OMP (outer-membrane proteins) and SQR enzymes (sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase) have a significant impact on the energy production efficiency of sulfur oxidation, which could have potential biotechnological applications.

Although the removal of NB and V(V) was reduced at increased loading of NB or V(V), supplementing more ethanol substantially improved the removal performance. A few genera (e.g., Alkalibacter, Anaerovorax, Dechloromonas, Xanthobacter, Acetobacterium, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12) were distinctively enriched in the bioreactors spiked with both NB and V(V). The metagenome analysis revealed functional genes (e.g., nbzAa, catA, CYC, pilA) that were affiliated with NB and V(V) removal. It is speculated that the NB was first electrochemically reduced to aniline, and then mineralized to other intermediates (e.g., catechol). Cathode donating electron, glutathione and nitrite-reductase contributed to the bioreduction of V(V) to tetravalent vanadium.

	abstract = {The availability of an ever-increasing diversity of prokaryotic genomes and metagenomes represents a major opportunity to understand and decipher the mechanisms behind the functional diversification of microbial biosynthetic pathways. However, it remains unclear to what extent a pathway producing a specific molecule from a specific precursor can diversify. In this study, we focus on the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (UQ), a crucial coenzyme that is central to the bioenergetics and to the functioning of a wide variety of enzymes in Eukarya and Pseudomonadota (a subgroup of the formerly named Proteobacteria). UQ biosynthesis involves three hydroxylation reactions on contiguous carbon atoms. We and others have previously shown that these reactions are catalyzed by different sets of UQ-hydroxylases that belong either to the iron-dependent Coq7 family or to the more widespread flavin monooxygenase (FMO) family. Here, we combine an experimental approach with comparative genomics and phylogenetics to reveal how UQ-hydroxylases evolved different selectivities within the constrained framework of the UQ pathway. It is shown that the UQ-FMOs diversified via at least three duplication events associated with two cases of neofunctionalization and one case of subfunctionalization, leading to six subfamilies with distinct hydroxylation selectivity. We also demonstrate multiple transfers of the UbiM enzyme and the convergent evolution of UQ-FMOs toward the same function, which resulted in two independent losses of the Coq7 ancestral enzyme. Diversification of this crucial biosynthetic pathway has therefore occurred via a combination of parallel evolution, gene duplications, transfers, and losses.  © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Water reuse from wastewater sources still remain some critical safety concerns associated with treacherous contaminants like pathogenic viruses. In this study, viral diversities in campus wastewater (CWW) and its reclaimed water (RCW) recycled for toilet flushing and garden irrigation of a university dormitory were assessed using metagenomic sequencing for acquisition of more background data. Results suggested majority (>80%) of gene sequences within assembled contigs predicted by open reading frame (ORF) finder were no-hit yet believed to be novel/unrevealed viral genomic information whereas hits matched bacteriophages (i.e., mainly Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae families) were predominant in both CWW and RCW samples. Moreover, few pathogenic viruses (<1%) related to infections of human skin (e.g., Molluscum contagiosum virus, MCV), digestion system (e.g., hepatitis C virus, HCV), and gastrointestinal tract (e.g., human norovirus, HuNoV) were also noticed raising safety concerns about application of reclaimed waters. Low-affinity interactions of particular viral exterior proteins (e.g., envelope glycoproteins or spike proteins) for disinfectant ligand (e.g., chlorite) elucidated treatment limitations of current sewage processing systems even with membrane bioreactor and disinfectant contactor. Revolutionary disinfection approaches together with routine monitoring and new regulations are prerequisite to secure pathogen-correlated water quality for safer reuse of reclaimed waters. © 2023},

	abstract = {Many acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria used in the mining industry for the bioleaching of sulfidic minerals are intolerant to high chloride concentrations, resulting in problems where chloride occurs in the deposit at high concentrations or only seawater is available. In search for strains tolerating such conditions a tetrathionate- and iron-oxidizing bacterium was isolated from a tailings-contaminated beach sample at Portman Bay, Cartagena-La Union mining district, Spain, in the presence of 20 g l−1 (0.34 M) sodium chloride. The isolate was able to form spores, did not grow in the absence of NaCl, and oxidized ferrous iron in the presence of up to 1.5 M (∼87 g l−1) NaCl. Genome sequencing based on a combination of Illumina and PacBio reads revealed two contigs, a circular bacterial chromosome of 5.2 Mbp and a plasmid of 90 kbp, respectively. The chromosome comprised seven different 16S rRNA genes. Submission of the chromosome to the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) without preselection of similar sequences revealed exclusively type strains of the genus Alicyclobacillus. In the TYGS analyses the respective most similar species were dependent on whether the final tree was derived from just 16S rRNA, from the genomes, or from the proteomes. Thus, TYGS analysis clearly showed that isolate SO9 represents a novel species of the genus Alicyclobacillus. In the presence of artificial seawater with almost 0.6 M chloride, the addition of Alicyclobacillus sp. SO9 improved copper dissolution from chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) compared to abiotic leaching without bacteria. The new isolate SO9, therefore, has potential for bioleaching at elevated chloride concentrations. © 2023 Institut Pasteur},

	abstract = {To better understand bacterial communities and metabolism under nitrogen deficiency, 154 seawater samples were obtained from 5 to 200 m at 22 stations in the photic zone of the Western North Pacific Ocean. Total 634 nitrate-utilizing bacteria were isolated using selective media and culture-dependent methods, and 295 of them were positive for nitrate reduction. These nitrate-reducing bacteria belonged to 19 genera and 29 species and among them, Qipengyuania flava, Roseibium aggregatum, Erythrobacter aureus, Vibrio campbellii, and Stappia indica were identified from all tested seawater layers of the photic zone and at almost all stations. Twenty-nine nitrate-reducing strains representing different species were selected for further the study of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon metabolism. All 29 nitrate-reducing isolates contained genes encoding dissimilatory nitrate reduction or assimilatory nitrate reduction. Six nitrate-reducing isolates can oxidize thiosulfate based on genomic analysis and activity testing, indicating that nitrate-reducing thiosulfate-oxidizing bacteria exist in the photic zone. Five nitrate-reducing isolates obtained near the chlorophyll a-maximum layer contained a dimethylsulfoniopropionate synthesis gene and three of them contained both dimethylsulfoniopropionate synthesis and cleavage genes. This suggests that nitrate-reducing isolates may participate in dimethylsulfoniopropionate synthesis and catabolism in photic seawater. The presence of multiple genes for chitin degradation and extracellular peptidases may indicate that almost all nitrate-reducing isolates (28/29) can use chitin and proteinaceous compounds as important sources of carbon and nitrogen. Collectively, these results reveal culturable nitrate-reducing bacterial diversity and have implications for understanding the role of such strains in the ecology and biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon in the oligotrophic marine photic zone. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Phytoremediation, a cost-effective, eco-friendly alternative to conventional remediation, could expand efforts to remediate arsenic-contaminated soils. As with other pollutants, the plant microbiome may improve phytoremediation outcomes for arsenic-contaminated sites. We used in vitro and in silico methods to compare the arsenic resistance mechanisms, synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), biofilm formation, and plant growth-promoting abilities of the endophytes Pseudomonas sp. PD9R and Rahnella laticis PD12R. PD12R, which tolerates arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) to concentrations fivefold greater than PD9R, synthesizes high volumes of EPS in response to arsenic, and sequesters arsenic in the capsular EPS and cells. While arsenic exposure induced EPS synthesis in both strains, only PD12R continued to form biofilms at high As(III) and As(V) concentrations. The effects of endophyte inoculation on Arabidopsis growth varied by strain and As(V) concentration, and PD9R had positive effect on plants exposed to low levels of arsenic. Comparative genomic analyses exploring the EPS synthesis and arsenic resistance mechanisms against other Pseudomonas and Rahnella strains suggest that both strains possess atypical arsenic resistance mechanisms from other plant-associated strains, while the configuration of the EPS synthesis systems appeared to be more broadly distributed among plant- and non-plant-associated strains. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities display a wide array of ecosystem services and play a crucial role in various geogenic processes from soil formation to biological weathering. They are considered vital agents in all earth-building processes. The activities of microbial communities upon rocks are mainly focused on soil formation, mineralization, and biogeochemical cycling. Recent research investigations by scientists across the globe have thrown much light on the association and the overall benefits of weathering bacteria on overall ecosystem and especially plant growth. The ecological factors are so strongly correlated that the sustainable agriculture techniques are actually involving inoculations of weathering bacteria in soil or plants, especially combined with the use of crushed rocks, to increase soil fertility and improve crop production. Microbial interaction with rocks can be regarded as old as the age of rocks, the specific patterns as evident from the electron micrographic studies of several prehistoric rock particles provides evidences of microbial activity. This chapter would majorly focus on the various types of microbial interactions with rocks, types of microbes involved in the process of weathering, and the mechanisms used by microorganisms for weathering activities. This chapter further investigates on metagenomic and New-Generation Sequencing approaches of understanding microbial weathering processes as well as functional role of microbial communities in weathering and erosion. It is pertinent to note that the impact of global climate change on microorganisms is humongous and ecologists are analyzing the evolutionary role of microorganisms in mitigating climate change. The conclusion would throw light on the broader prospects of microbial weathering with reference to its significance in maintaining ecological balance and multidisciplinary applications of microbes. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Continental hydrothermal systems (CHSs) are geochemically complex, and they support microbial communities that vary across substrates. However, our understanding of these variations across the complete range of substrates in CHS is limited because many previous studies have focused predominantly on aqueous settings. Methods: Here we used metagenomes in the context of their environmental geochemistry to investigate the ecology of different substrates (i.e., water, mud and fumarolic deposits) from Solfatara and Pisciarelli. Results and Discussion: Results indicate that both locations are lithologically similar with distinct fluid geochemistry. In particular, all substrates from Solfatara have similar chemistry whereas Pisciarelli substrates have varying chemistry; with water and mud from bubbling pools exhibiting high SO42− and NH4+ concentrations. Species alpha diversity was found to be different between locations but not across substrates, and pH was shown to be the most important driver of both diversity and microbial community composition. Based on cluster analysis, microbial community structure differed significantly between Pisciarelli substrates but not between Solfatara substrates. Pisciarelli mud pools, were dominated by (hyper)thermophilic archaea, and on average, bacteria dominated Pisciarelli fumarolic deposits and all investigated Solfatara environments. Carbon fixation and sulfur oxidation were the most important metabolic pathways fueled by volcanic outgassing at both locations. Together, results demonstrate that ecological differences across substrates are not a widespread phenomenon but specific to the system. Therefore, this study demonstrates the importance of analyzing different substrates of a CHS to understand the full range of microbial ecology to avoid biased ecological assessments.

	abstract = {Background: Archaea of the order Thermoplasmatales are widely distributed in natural acidic areas and are amongst the most acidophilic prokaryotic organisms known so far. These organisms are difficult to culture, with currently only six genera validly published since the discovery of Thermoplasma acidophilum in 1970. Moreover, known great diversity of uncultured Thermoplasmatales represents microbial dark matter and underlines the necessity of efforts in cultivation and study of these archaea. Organisms from the order Thermoplasmatales affiliated with the so-called “alphabet-plasmas”, and collectively dubbed “E-plasma”, were the focus of this study. These archaea were found predominantly in the hyperacidic site PM4 of Parys Mountain, Wales, UK, making up to 58% of total metagenomic reads. However, these archaea escaped all cultivation attempts. Results: Their genome-based metabolism revealed its peptidolytic potential, in line with the physiology of the previously studied Thermoplasmatales isolates. Analyses of the genome and evolutionary history reconstruction have shown both the gain and loss of genes, that may have contributed to the success of the “E-plasma” in hyperacidic environment compared to their community neighbours. Notable genes among them are involved in the following molecular processes: signal transduction, stress response and glyoxylate shunt, as well as multiple copies of genes associated with various cellular functions; from energy production and conversion, replication, recombination, and repair, to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and archaella production. History events reconstruction shows that these genes, acquired by putative common ancestors, may determine the evolutionary and functional divergences of “E-plasma”, which is much more developed than other representatives of the order Thermoplasmatales. In addition, the ancestral hereditary reconstruction strongly indicates the placement of Thermogymnomonas acidicola close to the root of the Thermoplasmatales. Conclusions: This study has analysed the metagenome-assembled genome of “E-plasma”, which denotes the basis of their predominance in Parys Mountain environmental microbiome, their global ubiquity, and points into the right direction of further cultivation attempts. The results suggest distinct evolutionary trajectories of organisms comprising the order Thermoplasmatales, which is important for the understanding of their evolution and lifestyle. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Microorganisms play crucial roles in the global iodine cycling through iodine oxidation, reduction, volatilization, and deiodination. In contrast to iodate formation in radionuclide-contaminated groundwater by the iodine-oxidizing bacteria, microbial contribution to the formation of high level of iodide in geogenic high iodine groundwater is poorly understood. In this study, our results of comparative metagenomic analyses of deep groundwater with typical high iodide concentrations in the North China Plain revealed the existence of putative dissimilatory iodate-reducing idrABP1P2 gene clusters in groundwater. Heterologous expression and characterization of an identified idrABP1P2 gene cluster confirmed its functional role in iodate reduction. Thus, microbial dissimilatory iodate reduction could contribute to iodide formation in geogenic high iodine groundwater. In addition, the identified iron-reducing, sulfur-reducing, sulfur-oxidizing, and dehalogenating bacteria in the groundwater could contribute to the release and production of iodide through the reductive dissolution of iron minerals, abiotic iodate reduction of derived ferrous iron and sulfide, and dehalogenation of organic iodine, respectively. These microbially mediated iodate reduction and organic iodine dehalogenation processes may also result in the transformation among iodine species and iodide enrichment in other geogenic iodine-rich groundwater systems worldwide. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {Soil, sediment, and waters contaminated with heavy metals pose a serious threat to ecosystem function and human health, and microorganisms are an effective way to address this problem. In this work, sediments containing heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Cd, As) were treated differently (sterilized and unsterilized) and bio-enhanced leaching experiments were carried out with the addition of exogenous iron-oxidizing bacteria A. ferrooxidans and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria A. thiooxidans. The leaching of As, Cd, Cu, and Zn was higher in the unsterilized sediment at the beginning 10 days, while heavy metals leached more optimally in the later sterilized sediment. The leaching of Cd from sterilized sediments was favored by A. ferrooxidans compared to A. thiooxidans. Meanwhile, the microbial community structure was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which revealed that 53.4% of the bacteria were Proteobacteria, 26.22% were Bacteroidetes, 5.04% were Firmicutes, 4.67% were Chlamydomonas, and 4.08% were Acidobacteria. DCA analysis indicated that microorganisms abundance (diversity and Chao values) increased with time. Furthermore, network analysis showed that complex networks of interactions existed in the sediments. After adapting to the acidic environmental conditions, the growth of some locally dominant bacteria increased the microbial interactions, allowing more bacteria to participate in the network, making their connections stronger. This evidence points to a disruption in the microbial community structure and its diversity following artificial disturbance, which then develops again over time. These results could contribute to the understanding of the evolution of microbial communities in the ecosystem during the remediation of anthropogenically disturbed heavy metals. © 2023 by the authors.},

The biosynthesis of the aminocyclitol has been proposed to proceed through six enzymatic steps from glucose 6-phosphate through myo-inositol to the final methylenedioxy-containing aminocyclitol. Although there is some in vivo evidence for this proposed pathway, biochemical support for the individual enzyme activities is lacking. In this study, we verify the activity for one enzyme in this pathway. We show that Hyg17 is a myo-inositol dehydrogenase that has a unique substrate scope when compared to other myo-inositol dehydrogenases.

	abstract = {Salt mines are a special type of hypersaline environment. Current research mainly focuses on prokaryotes, and the understanding of viruses in salt mines remains limited. Understanding viruses in hypersaline environments is of great significance for revealing the formation and maintenance of microbial communities, energy flow and element cycling, and host ecological functions. A phage infecting Halomonas titanicae was isolated from Yipinglang Salt Mine in China, designated Halomonas titanicae phage vB_HtiS_YPHTV-1 (YPHTV-1). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that YPHTV-1 had an icosahedral head with a diameter of 49.12 ± 0.15 nm (n = 5) and a long noncontractile tail with a length of 141.7 ± 0.58 nm (n = 5), indicating that it was a siphovirus. The one-step growth curve showed that the burst size of YPHTV-1 was 69 plaque forming units (PFUs) cell−1. The genome of YPHTV-1 was 37,980 bp with a GC content of 36.2%. The phylogenetic analysis of the six conserved proteins indicated that YPHTV-1 formed a cluster with Bacillus phages and was separated from phages infecting Halomonas. The average nucleotide identity (ANI), phylogenetic, and network analyses indicated that the phage YPHTV-1 represented a new genus under Caudoviricetes. In total, 57 open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the YPHTV-1 genome, 30 of which could be annotated in the database. Notably, several auxiliary metabolic genes were encoded by YPHTV-1, such as ImmA/IrrE family metalloendopeptidase, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) folding metallohydrolase, M15 family of metal peptidases, MazG-like family protein, O antigen ligase, and acyltransferase. These genes potentially enabled the host bacterium to resist ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light (UV), mitomycin C, β-lactam antibiotic, high osmotic pressure, and nutritional deficiencies. These findings highlight the role of haloviruses in the life cycle of halobacteria. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Mine tailing sites provide profound opportunities to elucidate the microbial mechanisms involved in ecosystem functioning. In the present study, metagenomic analysis of dumping soil and adjacent pond around India’s largest copper mine at Malanjkhand has been done. Taxonomic analysis deciphered the abundance of phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Genomic signatures of viruses were predicted in the soil metagenome, whereas Archaea and Eukaryotes were noticed in water samples. Mesophilic chemolithotrophs, such as Acidobacteria bacterium, Chloroflexi bacterium, and Verrucomicrobia bacterium, were predominant in soil, whereas, in the water sample, the abundance of Methylobacterium mesophilicum, Pedobacter sp., and Thaumarchaeota archaeon was determined. The functional potential analysis highlighted the abundance of genes related to sulfur, nitrogen, methane, ferrous oxidation, carbon fixation, and carbohydrate metabolisms. The genes for copper, iron, arsenic, mercury, chromium, tellurium, hydrogen peroxide, and selenium resistance were found to be predominant in the metagenomes. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed from the sequencing data, indicating novel microbial species genetically related to the phylum predicted through whole genome metagenomics. Phylogenetic analysis, genome annotations, functional potential, and resistome analysis showed the resemblance of assembled novel MAGs with traditional organisms used in bioremediation and biomining applications. Microorganisms harboring adaptive mechanisms, such as detoxification, hydroxyl radical scavenging, and heavy metal resistance, could be the potent benefactions for their utility as bioleaching agents. The genetic information produced in the present investigation provides a foundation for pursuing and understanding the molecular aspects of bioleaching and bioremediation applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Management of tailings at metal mine smelter sites can reduce the potential hazards associated with exposure to toxic metal(loid)s and residual organic flotation reagents. In addition, microbes in the tailings harboring multi-resistance genes (e.g., tolerance to multiple antimicrobial agents) can cause high rates of morbidity and global economic problems. The potential co-selection mechanisms of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal(loid) resistance genes (MRGs) during tailings sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) treatment have been poorly investigated. Samples were collected from a nonferrous metal mine tailing site treated with an established SRB protocol and were analyzed for selected geochemical properties and high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene barcoding. Based on the shotgun metagenomic analysis, the bacterial domain was dominant in nonferrous metal(loid)-rich tailings treated with SRB for 12 months. KEGGs related to ARGs and MRGs were detected. Thiobacillus and Sphingomonas were the main genera carrying the bacA and mexEF resistance operons, along with Sulfuricella which were also found as the main genera carrying MRGs. The SRB treatment may mediate the distribution of numerous resistance genes. KOs based on the metagenomic database indicated that ARGs (mexNW, merD, sul, and bla) and MRGs (czcABCR and copRS genes) were found on the same contig. The SRB strains (Desulfosporosinus and Desulfotomaculum), and the acidophilic strain Acidiphilium significantly contributed to the distribution of sul genes. The functional metabolic pathways related to siderophores metabolism were largely from anaerobic genera of Streptomyces and Microbacterium. The presence of arsenate reductase, metal efflux pump, and Fe transport genes indicated that SRB treatment plays a key role in the metal(loid)s transformation. Overall, our findings show that bio-treatment is an effective tool for managing ARGs/MRGs and metals in tailings that contain numerous metal(loid) contaminants. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Energy is one of the most complex fields of study and an issue that influences nearly every aspect of modern life. Over the past century, combustion of fossil fuels, particularly in the transportation sector, has been the dominant form of energy release. Refining of petroleum and natural gas into liquid transportation fuels is also the centerpiece of the modern chemical industry used to produce materials, solvents, and other consumer goods. In the face of global climate change, the world is searching for alternative, sustainable means of producing energy carriers and chemical building blocks. The use of biofuels in engines predates modern refinery optimization and today represents a small but significant fraction of liquid transportation fuels burnt each year. Similarly, white biotechnology has been used to produce many natural products through fermentation. The evolution of recombinant DNA technology into modern synthetic biology has expanded the scope of biofuels and bioproducts that can be made by biocatalysts. This opinion examines the current trends in this research space, highlighting the substantial growth in computational tools and the growing influence of renewable electricity in the design of metabolic engineering strategies. In short, advanced biofuel and bioproduct synthesis remains a vibrant and critically important field of study whose focus is shifting away from the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass toward a broader consideration of how to reduce carbon dioxide to fuels and chemical products. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Until now, studies on cave microbiomes have included taxonomic classification through metagenomics analysis, demonstrating microbiological heterogeneity mainly composed of prokaryotic organisms or bacteria species. The generally oligotrophic environment, with limited energy input and dark zone, is the main feature differentiating the cave microorganisms from the other microbiomes and resulting in a unique habitat, which has unexplored regard to biology and chemical diversity. Multi-omics integration is a key strategy for scanning and integrating the macro and micromolecular universe, providing a better comprehension of processes and answers of the microbiome in natural cavities.

	abstract = {Myxobacteria, belonging to the phylum Myxococcota, are ubiquitous in soil, marine, and other environments. A recent metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that Myxococcota are predominant in activated sludge systems; however, their metabolic traits remain unclear. In the present study, we examined the potential biological functions of 46 metagenomic bins of Myxococcota reconstructed from activated sludge samples from four municipal sewage treatment plants. The results obtained showed that most Myxococcota bins had an almost complete set of genes associated with glycolysis and the TCA cycle. The Palsa-1104 and Polyangiales bins contained the glycoside hydrolase GH5 and peptidase M23, which are presumably involved in lysis of the cell wall and cellular cytoplasm, suggesting that some Myxococcota from activated sludge prey on other microorganisms. The cell contact-dependent predatory functions of Myxococcus xanthus are conserved in the family Myxococcaceae, but not in other families. Two bins belonging to Palsa-1104 had phototrophic gene clusters, indicating the potential for heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolism by these microbes. In assessments of the social behavior of Myxococcota in activated sludge, the FruA gene and C-signal gene, which are involved in the regulation of fruiting body formation, were lacking in Myxococcota bins, suggesting their inability to form fruiting bodies. In addition, multiple bins of Myxococcota had novel secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters that may be used for the predation of other bacteria in activated sludge. Our metagenome-based analyses provide novel insights into the microbial interactions associated with Myxococcota in activated sludge ecosystems. © Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology.},

	abstract = {A consensus is emerging on marine microbial biogeography. However, knowledge of the biodiversity and biogeographic patterns of deep-sea microbes and the drivers is far from adequate. In this study, we investigated the diversity and biogeography of prokaryotes at the Indian Ocean Ridges (IOR) using 16S rRNA gene and dsrB sequencing combined with bioinformatics analyses. A total of 39 hydrothermal field sediment (HFS) and non-hydrothermal field sediment (NHFS) samples were collected from the Carlsberg Ridge (CR) and Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR). Seventy-four prokaryotic phyla were detected in the samples, of which 13 phyla were distributed across all samples. The composition of prokaryotic communities diverged between HFSs and NHFSs, but not between the CR and SWIR. Sixteen phyla were differentially enriched between HFSs and NHFSs. The community structure was significantly correlated to calcium, sulfur, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen, the first three of which were the main distinguishing factors of HFSs and NHFSs. Moreover, a weak distance–decay pattern was observed among the NHFS communities. PICRUSt predictions revealed functional discrepancies in carbon and nitrogen metabolism between the HFS and NHFS communities, and dsrB sequencing analysis indicated higher diversity of sulfate reduction genes and taxa in HFSs than in NHFSs. The diversity and relative abundance of corresponding functional taxa and genes suggested that the nitrogen cycle might be centralized in an energy-generating manner to support the microbial community in NHFSs while the sulfur cycle is more important for the HFS community. These findings provide new insights into microbial biogeography and metabolic differentiation along the IOR that are influenced by hydrothermal activity.

	abstract = {In the biogeochemical cycle, sulfur oxidation plays a vital role and is typically referred to as the elemental sulfur or reductive sulfide oxidation process. This study aimed to characterize a subtropical mangrove-isolated bacterial strain using biochemical, whole-genome, and transcriptome sequencing analyses to enhance our understanding of sulfur metabolism and biodegradation from a molecular genetic perspective. Strain NM1-A2 was characterized as Gram-positive and found to have a close molecular phylogenetic relationship with Bacillus aryabhattai. NM1-A2 efficiently converted dibenzothiophene (DBT) into 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) via a 4S pathway with 95% efficiency, using enzymes encoded by the dsz operon (dszA, dszB, and dszC), which determine monooxygenases (DszA & DszC) and desulfinase (DszB). The whole-genome sequence of NM1-A2 had a length of approximately 5,257,678 bp and included 16 sulfur metabolism-related genes, featuring the ABC transport system, small subunit (ssu) and cysteine (cys) gene families, and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthesis-related genes. Transcriptomic analysis of NM1-A2 using three sulfur groups—magnesium sulfate (MS), sulfur powder (SP), and sodium thiosulfate (ST) resulted in a significant number of differentially expressed genes (1200, 2304, and 2001, respectively). This analysis revealed that intracellular cysteine concentration directly regulated the expression of cys and ssu genes. Sulfate did not directly affect cys gene expression but repressed ssu gene expression. The cys gene expression levels decreased during the conversion of sulfate to sulfide and cysteine. The transcriptomic data was validated by analyzing the expression patterns of NM1-A2 using real-time quantitative PCR validation analysis. The expression levels of cysl, mccB, and nrnA were significantly upregulated, while cysH, metB, and sat were downregulated in the SP, ST, and MS groups, respectively. This research contributes to our understanding of marine mangrove microorganisms' bacterial efficiency through characterization, whole-genome, and transcriptome sequencing-based molecular degradation of organic compounds in the mangrove ecosystem, which may enhance nutrient availability. © 2023},

	abstract = {Acinetobacter guillouiae SFC 500-1 A is a promising candidate for the bioremediation of tannery wastewater. In this study, we applied shotgun proteomic technology in conjunction with a gel-based assay (Gel-LC) to explore the strain's intracellular protein profile when grown in tannery wastewater as opposed to normal culture conditions. A total of 1775 proteins were identified, 52 of which were unique to the tannery wastewater treatment. Many of them were connected to the degradation of aromatic compounds and siderophore biosynthesis. On the other hand, 1598 proteins overlapped both conditions but were differentially expressed in each. Those that were upregulated in wastewater (109) were involved in the processes mentioned above, as well as in oxidative stress mitigation and intracellular redox state regulation. Particularly interesting were the downregulated proteins under the same treatment (318), which were diverse but mainly linked to the regulation of basic cellular functions (replication, transcription, translation, cell cycle, and wall biogenesis); metabolism (amino acids, lipids, sulphate, energetic processes); and other more complex responses (cell motility, exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing). The findings suggest that SFC 500-1 A engages in survival and stress management strategies to cope with the toxic effects of tannery wastewater, and that such strategies may be mostly oriented at keeping metabolic processes to a minimum. Altogether, the results might be useful in the near future to improve the strain's effectiveness if it will be applied for bioremediation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Rapid sand filters (RSF) are an established and widely applied technology for groundwater treatment. Yet, the underlying interwoven biological and physical-chemical reactions controlling the sequential removal of iron, ammonia and manganese remain poorly understood. To resolve the contribution and interactions between the individual reactions, we studied two full-scale drinking water treatment plant configurations, namely (i) one dual-media (anthracite and quartz sand) filter and (ii) two single-media (quartz sand) filters in series. In situ and ex situ activity tests were combined with mineral coating characterization and metagenome-guided metaproteomics along the depth of each filter. Both plants exhibited comparable performances and process compartmentalization, with most of ammonium and manganese removal occurring only after complete iron depletion. The homogeneity of the media coating and genome-based microbial composition within each compartment highlighted the effect of backwashing, namely the complete vertical mixing of the filter media. In stark contrast to this homogeneity, the removal of the contaminants was strongly stratified within each compartment, and decreased along the filter height. This apparent and longstanding conflict was resolved by quantifying the expressed proteome at different filter heights, revealing a consistent stratification of proteins catalysing ammonia oxidation and protein-based relative abundances of nitrifying genera (up to 2 orders of magnitude difference between top and bottom samples). This implies that microorganisms adapt their protein pool to the available nutrient load at a faster rate than the backwash mixing frequency. Ultimately, these results show the unique and complementary potential of metaproteomics to understand metabolic adaptations and interactions in highly dynamic ecosystems. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Subducting oceanic crusts release fluids rich in biologically relevant compounds into the overriding plate, fueling subsurface chemolithoautotrophic ecosystems. To understand the impact of subsurface geochemistry on microbial communities, we collected fluid and sediments from 14 natural springs across a ~200 km transect across the Costa Rican convergent margin and performed shotgun metagenomics. The resulting 404 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) cluster into geologically distinct regions based on MAG abundance patterns: outer forearc-only (25% of total relative abundance), forearc/arc-only (38% of total relative abundance), and delocalized (37% of total relative abundance) clusters. In the outer forearc, Thermodesulfovibrionia, Candidatus Bipolaricaulia, and Firmicutes have hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction and Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) carbon fixation pathways. In the forearc/arc, Anaerolineae, Ca. Bipolaricaulia, and Thermodesulfovibrionia have sulfur oxidation, nitrogen cycling, microaerophilic respiration, and WL, while Aquificae have aerobic sulfur oxidation and reverse tricarboxylic acid carbon fixation pathway. Transformation-based canonical correspondence analysis shows that MAG distribution corresponds to concentrations of aluminum, iron, nickel, dissolved inorganic carbon, and phosphate. While delocalized MAGs appear surface-derived, the subsurface chemolithoautotrophic, metabolic, and taxonomic landscape varies by the availability of minerals/metals and volcanically derived inorganic carbon.

	abstract = {A strain of Leptospirillum sp. CC previously isolated from Akhtala polymetallic ore (Armenia) was studied. The main morphological and physiological characteristics of CC were revealed. The optimal growth temperature was 40 °C and optimal pH 1.5. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (GenBank ID OM272948) showed that isolate CC was clustered with L. ferriphilum and possessed 99.8% sequence similarity with the strain L. ferriphilum OL12-2 (KF356024). The molar fraction of DNA (G + C) of the isolate was 58.5%. Bioleaching experiment indicates that L. ferriphilum CC can oxidize Fe(II) efficiently, and after 17 days, 44.1% of copper and 91.4% of iron are extracted from chalcopyrite and pyrite, respectively. The efficiency of L. ferriphilum CC in pyrite oxidation increases 1.7 times when co-cultivated with At. ferrooxidans ZnC. However, the highest activity in pyrite oxidation shows the association of L.ferriphilum CC with heterotrophic Acidocella sp. RBA bacteria. It was shown that bioleaching of copper and iron from chalcopyrite by association of L. ferriphilum CC, At. ferrooxidans ZnC, and At. albertensis SO-2 in comparison with pure culture L. ferriphilum CC for 21 days increased about 1.2 and 1.4–1.6 times, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effects of metals and physicochemical variables on the microbes and their metabolisms in the sediments of Guarapiranga reservoir, a tropical eutrophic-hypereutrophic freshwater reservoir located in a highly urbanized and industrialized area in Brazil. The metals cadmium, copper, and chromium showed minor contribution to changes in the structure, composition, and richness of sediment microbial communities and functions. However, the effects of metals on the microbiota are increased when taken together with physicochemical properties, including the sediment carbon and sulfur, the bottom water electrical conductivity, and the depth of the water column. Clearly, diverse anthropic activities, such as sewage discharge, copper sulfate application to control algal growth, water transfer, urbanization, and industrialization, contribute to increase these parameters and the metals spatially in the reservoir. Microbes found especially in metal-contaminated sites encompassed Bathyarchaeia, MBG-D and DHVEG-1, Halosiccatus, Candidatus Methanoperedens, Anaeromyxobacter, Sva0485, Thermodesulfovibrionia, Acidobacteria, and SJA-15, possibly showing metal resistance or acting in metal bioremediation. Knallgas bacteria, nitrate ammonification, sulfate respiration, and methanotrophy were inferred to occur in metal-contaminated sites and may also contribute to metal removal. This knowledge about the sediment microbiota and metabolisms in a freshwater reservoir impacted by anthropic activities allows new insights about their potential for metal bioremediation in these environments.

	abstract = {Background: Río Celeste (“Sky-Blue River”) is a river located in the Tenorio National Park (Costa Rica) that has become an important hotspot for eco-tourism due to its striking sky-blue color. A previous study indicated that this color is not caused by dissolved chemical species, but by formation of light-scattering aluminosilicate particles at the mixing point of two colorless streams, the acidic Quebrada Agria and the neutral Río Buenavista. Results: We now present microbiological information on Río Celeste and its two tributaries, as well as a more detailed characterization of the particles that occur at the mixing point. Our results overturn the previous belief that the light scattering particles are formed by the aggregation of smaller particles coming from Río Buenavista, and rather point to chemical formation of hydroxyaluminosilicate colloids when Quebrada Agria is partially neutralized by Río Buenavista, which also contributes silica to the reaction. The process is mediated by the activities of different microorganisms in both streams. In Quebrada Agria, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria generate an acidic environment, which in turn cause dissolution and mobilization of aluminum and other metals. In Río Buenavista, the growth of diatoms transforms dissolved silicon into colloidal biogenic forms which may facilitate particle precipitation. Conclusions: We show how the sky-blue color of Río Celeste arises from the tight interaction between chemical and biological processes, in what constitutes a textbook example of emergent behavior in environmental microbiology. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Membrane vesicles (MVs) are envelope-derived extracellular sacs that perform a broad diversity of physiological functions in bacteria. While considerably studied in pathogenic microorganisms, the roles, relevance, and biotechnological potential of MVs from environmental bacteria are less well established. Acidithiobacillaceae family bacteria are active players in the sulfur and iron biogeochemical cycles in extremely acidic environments and drivers of the leaching of mineral ores contributing to acid rock/mine drainage (ARD/AMD) and industrial bioleaching. One key aspect of such a role is the ability of these bacteria to tightly interact with the mineral surfaces and extract electrons and nutrients to support their chemolithotrophic metabolism. Despite recent advances in the characterization of acidithiobacilli biofilms and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, our understanding of its architectural and mechanistic aspects remains scant. Using different microscopy techniques and nano-tracking analysis we show that vesiculation is a common phenomenon in distant members of the Acidithiobacillaceae family, and further explore the role of MVs in multicellular colonization behaviors using ‘Fervidacidithiobacillus caldus’ as a bacterial model. Production of MVs in ‘F. caldus’ occurred in both planktonic cultures and biofilms formed on sulfur surfaces, where MVs appeared individually or in chains resembling tube-shaped membranous structures (TSMSs) important for microbial communication. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data and bioinformatic analysis of the MV-associated proteome revealed that ‘F. caldus’ MVs were enriched in proteins involved in cell–cell and cell–surface processes and largely typified the MVs as outer MVs (OMVs). Finally, microbiological assays showed that amendment of ‘F. caldus’ MVs to cells and/or biofilms affects collective colonizing behaviors relevant to the ecophysiology and applications of these acidophiles, providing grounds for their exploitation in biomining.

	abstract = {Sustainable agriculture is essential to attain food security and address increasing climate change concerns. Population, abiotic and biotic stresses and limited agricultural water supplies and land are important barriers to cereal crops production, in addition to extreme weather. These factors influence their quality and productivity. Therefore, there is a pressing need for effective methods of food production under these conditions. For many individuals in low- and middle-income nations, cereals represent a key food source. Developing cereal crops with enhanced flexibility, high yields, and the ability to tolerate these biotic and abiotic problems is therefore essential. Modern OMICS techniques, next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics tools and the most recent improvements in genome editing tools (GET) have made targeted mutagenesis conceivable. By altering a crop variety's endogenous genome, which is free of any foreign genes, genome editing (GE) enhances the crop variety. Therefore, crops that have undergone GE but have not integrated foreign genes are not considered genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a number of countries. GE is being used by researchers to promote the nutritional value of cereal crops and increase their tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. This review critically discusses the activities of GET, the role of bioinformatics tools and its application to sustainable agriculture for cereal crops. © (2024) Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The acidification of water in mining areas is a global environmental issue primarily catalyzed by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB). Little is known about microbial sulfur cycling in circumneutral pH mine tailing impoundment waters. Here we investigate biological sulfur oxidation over four years in a mine tailings impoundment water cap, integrating aqueous sulfur geochemistry, genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. The microbial community is consistently dominated by neutrophilic, chemolithoautotrophic SOB (relative abundances of ~76% in 2015, ~55% in 2016/2017 and ~60% in 2018). Results reveal two SOB strategies alternately dominate across the four years, influencing acid generation and sulfur speciation. Under oxic conditions, novel Halothiobacillus drive lower pH conditions (as low as 4.3) and lower [S2O32−] via the complete Sox pathway coupled to O2. Under anoxic conditions, Thiobacillus spp. dominate in activity, via the incomplete Sox and rDSR pathways coupled to NO3−, resulting in higher [S2O32−] and no net significant acidity generation. This study provides genomic evidence explaining acidity generation and thiosulfate accumulation patterns in a circumneutral mine tailing impoundment and has significant environmental applications in preventing the discharge of sulfur compounds that can impact downstream environments. These insights illuminate opportunities for in situ biotreatment of reduced sulfur compounds and prediction of acidification events using gene-based monitoring and in situ RNA detection. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Industrialization and other anthropogenic human activities pose significant environmental risks. As a result of the hazardous pollution, numerous living organisms may suffer from undesirable diseases in their separate habitats. Bioremediation, which removes hazardous compounds from the environment using microbes or their biologically active metabolites, is one of the most successful remediation approaches. According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), deteriorating soil health negatively impacts food security and human health over time. Soil health restoration is critical right now. Microbes are widely known for their importance in cleaning up toxins present in the soil, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and hydrocarbons. However, the capacity of local bacteria to digest these pollutants is limited, and the process takes an extended time. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs), whose altered metabolic pathways promote the over-secretion of a variety of proteins favorable to the bioremediation process, can speed up the breakdown process. The need for remediation procedures, degrees of soil contamination, site circumstances, broad adoptions, and numerous possibilities occurring at various cleaning stages are all studied in detail. Massive efforts to restore contaminated soils have also resulted in severe issues. This review focuses on the enzymatic removal of hazardous pollutants from the environment, such as pesticides, heavy metals, dyes, and plastics. There are also in-depth assessments of present discoveries and future plans for efficient enzymatic degradation of hazardous pollutants. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present research was to determine the metaphenome (the expressed microbial functions) of a calaminiferous soil mostly contaminated with Zn and Pb. For that, three 'omics approaches were combined using soil samples: shotgun metagenomics (MG), metatranscriptomics (MT) and shotgun metaproteomics (MP). Results show that several indexes of bacterial diversity were significantly reduced. The soil was dominated by Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes. Although many of the species were not identified, the mean percentages of reads for Candidatus_Solibacter, Bryobacter, Rhodomicrobium and Niastella were significantly more elevated in the contaminated soil when compared to a control soil. For functionality, the identified proteins were classified in 28 functional SEED categories. The MG approach detected many genes that may be used to degrade various types of organic materials, among which chitin, N-acetylglucosamine, cellulose and glycogen. This suggests that the important carbon cycle functions of the heterotrophic communities are maintained in the soil. For metal resistance, the most abundant proteins were P-type ATPases efflux systems. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Viruses are widespread in various ecosystems, and they play important roles in regulating the microbial community via host-virus interactions. Recently, metagenomic studies showed that there are extremely diverse viruses in different environments from the ocean to the human gut, but the influences of viral communities on microbial communities are poorly understood, especially in extreme environments. Here, we used metagenomics to characterize microbial communities and viral communities in acid mine drainage (AMD) and evaluated how viruses shape microbial community constrained by the harsh environments. Our results showed that AMD viral communities are significantly associated with the microbial communities, and viral diversity has positive correlations with microbial diversity. Viral community explained more variations of microbial community composition than environmental factors in AMD of a polymetallic mine. Moreover, we found that viruses harboring adaptive genes regulate a relative abundance of hosts under the modulation of environmental factors, such as pH. We also observed that viral diversity has significant correlations with the global properties of microbial cooccurrence networks, such as modularity. In addition, the results of null modeling analyses revealed that viruses significantly affect microbial community phylogeny and play important roles in regulating ecological processes of community assembly, such as dispersal limitation and homogenous dispersal. Together, these results revealed that AMD viruses are critical forces driving microbial network and community assembly via host-virus interactions. Copyright © 2023 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {The mitochondrial matrix peptidase CLPP is crucial during cell stress. Its loss causes Perrault syndrome type 3 (PRLTS3) with infertility, neurodegeneration, and a growth deficit. Its target proteins are disaggregated by CLPX, which also regulates heme biosynthesis via unfolding ALAS enzymes, providing access for pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP). Despite efforts in diverse organisms with multiple techniques, CLPXP substrates remain controversial. Here, avoiding recombinant overexpression, we employed complexomics in mitochondria from three mouse tissues to identify endogenous targets. A CLPP absence caused the accumulation and dispersion of CLPX-VWA8 as AAA+ unfoldases, and of PLPBP. Similar changes and CLPX-VWA8 co-migration were evident for mitoribosomal central protuberance clusters, translation factors like GFM1-HARS2, the RNA granule components LRPPRC-SLIRP, and enzymes OAT-ALDH18A1. Mitochondrially translated proteins in testes showed reductions to <30% for MTCO1-3, the mis-assembly of the complex IV supercomplex, and accumulated metal-binding assembly factors COX15-SFXN4. Indeed, heavy metal levels were increased for iron, molybdenum, cobalt, and manganese. RT-qPCR showed compensatory downregulation only for Clpx mRNA; most accumulated proteins appeared transcriptionally upregulated. Immunoblots validated VWA8, MRPL38, MRPL18, GFM1, and OAT accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed CLPX binding to MRPL38, GFM1, and OAT, so excess CLPX and PLP may affect their activity. Our data mechanistically elucidate the mitochondrial translation fidelity deficits which underlie progressive hearing impairment in PRLTS3. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, their performance in the field remains variable and unpredictable. Two bioreactors filled with distinct biomass carriers (plastic or a mix of wood and pozzolana) were monitored during 1 year. We characterized the dynamic of the bacterial communities in these bioreactors, and explored the influence of environmental and operational drivers on their diversity and activity. Bacterial diversity was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. The aioA genes and transcripts were quantified by qPCR and RT-qPCR. Bacterial communities were dominated by several iron-oxidizing genera. Shifts in the communities were attributed to operational and physiochemical parameters including the nature of the biomass carrier, the water pH, temperature, arsenic, and iron concentrations. The bioreactor filled with wood and pozzolana showed a better resilience to disturbances, related to a higher bacterial alpha diversity. We evidenced for the first time aioA expression in a treatment system, associated with the presence of active Thiomonas spp. This confirmed the contribution of biological arsenite oxidation to arsenic removal. The resilience and the functional redundancy of the communities developed in the bioreactors conferred robustness and stability to the treatment systems. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Remorins, plant-specific proteins, have a significant role in conferring on plants the ability to adapt to adverse environments. However, the precise function of remorins in resistance to biological stress remains largely unknown. Eighteen CaREM genes were identified in pepper genome sequences based on the C-terminal conserved domain that is specific to remorin proteins in this research. Phylogenetic relations, chromosomal localization, motif, gene structures, and promoter regions of these remorins were analyzed and a remorin gene, CaREM1.4, was cloned for further study. The transcription of CaREM1.4 in pepper was induced by infection with Ralstonia solanacearum. Knocking down CaREM1.4 in pepper using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technologies reduced the resistance of pepper plants to R. solanacearum and downregulated the expression of immunity-associated genes. Conversely, transient overexpression of CaREM1.4 in pepper and Nicotiana benthamiana plants triggered hypersensitive response-mediated cell death and upregulated expression of defense-related genes. In addition, CaRIN4-12, which interacted with CaREM1.4 at the plasma membrane and cell nucleus, was knocked down with VIGS, decreasing the susceptibility of Capsicum annuum to R. solanacearum. Furthermore, CaREM1.4 reduced ROS production by interacting with CaRIN4-12 upon co-injection in pepper. Taken together, our findings suggest that CaREM1.4 may function as a positive regulator of the hypersensitive response, and it interacts with CaRIN4-12, which negatively regulates plant immune responses of pepper to R. solanacearum. Our study provides new evidence for comprehending the molecular regulatory network of plant cell death. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD) serves as an ideal model system for investigating microbial ecology, interaction, and assembly mechanism in natural environments. While previous studies have explored the structure and function of microbial communities in AMD, the succession patterns of microbial association networks and underlying assembly mechanisms during natural attenuation processes remain elusive. Here, we investigated prokaryotic microbial diversity and community assembly along an AMD-impacted river, from the extremely acidic, heavily polluted headwaters to the nearly neutral downstream sites. Microbial diversity was increased along the river, and microbial community composition shifted from acidophile-dominated to freshwater taxa-dominated communities. The complexity and relative modularity of the microbial networks were also increased, indicating greater network stability during succession. Deterministic processes, including abiotic selection of pH and high contents of sulfur and iron, governed community assembly in the headwaters. Although the stochasticity ratio was increased downstream, manganese content, microbial negative cohesion, and relative modularity played important roles in shaping microbial community structure. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the ecological processes that govern microbial community succession in AMD-impacted riverine ecosystems. These findings have important implications for in-situ remediation of AMD contamination. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Low temperature and acidic environments encompass natural milieus such as acid rock drainage in Antarctica and anthropogenic sites including drained sulfidic sediments in Scandinavia. The microorganisms inhabiting these environments include polyextremophiles that are both extreme acidophiles (defined as having an optimum growth pH < 3), and eurypsychrophiles that grow at low temperatures down to approximately 4°C but have an optimum temperature for growth above 15°C. Eurypsychrophilic acidophiles have important roles in natural biogeochemical cycling on earth and potentially on other planetary bodies and moons along with biotechnological applications in, for instance, low-temperature metal dissolution from metal sulfides. Five low-temperature acidophiles are characterized, namely, Acidithiobacillus ferriphilus, Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, “Ferrovum myxofaciens,” and Alicyclobacillus disulfidooxidans, and their characteristics are reviewed. Our understanding of characterized and environmental eurypsychrophilic acidophiles has been accelerated by the application of “omics” techniques that have aided in revealing adaptations to low pH and temperature that can be synergistic, while other adaptations are potentially antagonistic. The lack of known acidophiles that exclusively grow below 15°C may be due to the antagonistic nature of adaptations in this polyextremophile. In conclusion, this review summarizes the knowledge of eurypsychrophilic acidophiles and places the information in evolutionary, environmental, biotechnological, and exobiology perspectives.

	abstract = {Introduction: Alcanivorax, a typical alkane-degrading bacterium, has demonstrated the ability to utilize inorganic electron donor in some reports. However, a comprehensive analysis of its potentiality to utilize inorganic electron donor is still lacking. Methods: In this study, genomic and phylogenetic analyzes were used to explore the potential oxidative capacity of inorganic compounds in Alcanivorax. And its functions were verified through physiological experiments. Results: The sulfur oxidation-related genes sqr and tsdA are prevalent and have various evolutionary origins. Potential genes for CO oxidation were present in 39 strains, whereas genes associated with iron, hydrogen, and ammonia oxidation were either rare or absent. The physiological functions of Sqr and TsdA were confirmed in six representative strains under heterotrophic conditions. Adding thiosulfate enhanced Alcanivorax growth. However, Alcanivorax bacteria perform sulfide detoxification through Sqr rather than by gaining energy via sulfide oxidation Although no strain was confirmed to be chemoautotrophs, we discovered that the two clades, A. xenomutans and A. profundimaris, can grow under conditions with very low organic matter. Discussion: The ability to utilize inorganic compounds as a supplementary energy source and adapt to carbon oligotrophic growth may contribute to the prevalence of Alcanivorax in marine ecosystems.

	abstract = {The general trend in biomining (i.e., bioleaching and biooxidation) is the use of media with high concentrations of the nutrients (nitrogen as ammonium, phosphorous as phosphate, and K), which are considered to be essential for microbial growth. The depletion of any of the nutrients would affect negatively the bioleaching (and biooxidation) capacity of the microorganisms, so the formulation of the different media ensures that there is a surplus of nutrients. However, some of these nutrients (e.g., phosphate, K) may be already present in the ore and are made available to the microorganisms when the ore is exposed to the low-pH media used during bioleaching. The effect of phosphate addition (109 mg/L) and depletion on the bioleaching of low-grade sulfidic ore alongside the determination of ammonium (i.e., 25 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 109 mg/L, 409 mg/L, and 874 g/L) requirements were studied. The results of the experiments presented showed that the addition of phosphate did not have any effect on the bioleaching of the low-grade sulfidic ore while the addition of ammonium was necessary to obtain higher redox potentials (>650 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) and higher metal (Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn) dissolutions. Temperature was the factor that shaped the microbial communities, at 30°C, the microbial community at the end of all the experiments was dominated by Acidithiobacillus sp. as well as at 42°C, except when nutrients were not added and Sulfobacillus sp. was the dominant microorganism. At 55°C, DNA recovery was unsuccessful, and at 60°C, the microbial communities were dominated by Sulfolobus sp. In conclusion, the amount of nutrients in bioleaching could be reduced significantly to achieve the redox potentials and metal dissolution desired in bioleaching without affecting the microbial communities and bioleaching efficiencies.

	abstract = {Transcription regulation is a critical means by which microorganisms sense and adapt to their environments. Bacteria contain a wide range of highly conserved families of transcription factors that have evolved to regulate diverse sets of genes. It is increasingly apparent that structural similarities between transcription factors do not always equate to analogous transcription regulatory networks. For example, transcription factors within the copper-sensing operon repressor (CsoR)–resistance to cobalt and nickel repressor family have been found to repress a wide range of gene targets, including various metal efflux genes, as well as genes involved in sulfide and formaldehyde detoxification machinery. In this study, we identify the preferred DNA-binding sequence for the CsoR-like protein, TTHA1953, from the model extremophile Thermus thermophilus HB8 using the iterative selection approach, restriction endonuclease, protection, selection, and amplification. By mapping significant DNA motifs to the T. thermophilus HB8 genome, we identify potentially regulated genes that we validate with in vitro and in vivo methodologies. We establish TTHA1953 as a master regulator of the sulfur oxidation pathway, providing the first link between CsoR-like proteins and Sox regulation. © 2023 The Authors},

These microorganisms, as well as other extremophile bacteria, offer an attractive platform for environmental and industrial biotechnology because of their robust operating conditions and capacity to grow using low-cost substrates. In this study, we isolated Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum str. Pic from a crater lake located in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. We sequenced the genome and built a genome-scale metabolic model. The manually curated model contains 667 metabolites, 729 reactions, and 473 genes. Predicted flux distributions using flux balance analysis identified changes in redox trade-offs under methanotrophic and autotrophic conditions (H2+CO2). This was also predicted under heterotrophic conditions (acetone, isopropanol, and propane). Model validation was performed by testing the capacity of the strains to grow using four substrates: CH4, acetone, isopropanol, and LP-Gas. The results suggest that the metabolism of M. fumariolicum str. Pic is limited by the regeneration of redox equivalents such as NAD(P)H and reduced cytochromes.

	abstract = {Efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor couple presents a necessary requirement for acidophilic and neutrophilic iron oxidizers due to the low energy yield of aerobic ferrous iron oxidation. Involved periplasmic electron carriers are very diverse in these bacteria and show adaptations to the respective thermodynamic constraints such as a more positive redox potential reported for extreme acidophilic Acidithiobacillus spp. Respiratory chain candidates of moderately acidophilic members of the genus Ferrovum share similarities with both their neutrophilic iron oxidizing relatives and the more distantly related Acidithiobacillus spp. We examined our previous omics-based conclusions on the potential electron transfer chain in Ferrovum spp. by characterizing the three redox protein candidates CytC-18, CytC-78 and HiPIP-41 of strain PN-J47-F6 which were produced as recombinant proteins in Eschericha coli. UV/Vis-based redox assays suggested that HiPIP-41 has a very positive redox potential while redox potentials of CytC-18 and CytC-78 are more negative than their counterparts in Acidithiobacillus spp. Far Western dot blotting demonstrated interactions between all three recombinant redox proteins while redox assays showed the electron transfer from HiPIP-41 to either of the cytochromes. Altogether, CytC-18, CytC-78 and HiPIP-41 indeed represent very likely candidates of the electron transfer in Ferrovum sp. PN-J4-F6. © 2023 Institut Pasteur},

	abstract = {High temperature and sulfur concentrations in geothermal sulfur fumaroles host unique microbial ecosystems with niche-specific metabolic diversity and physiological functions. In this study, the microbial communities and their functionalities associated with the Dayoukeng geothermal field and the rock-soil–plant continuum were investigated to underpin the microbial modulation at different distances from the fumaroles source. At the phylum level, Bacteroidota, Planctomycetota, Armatimonadota, and Patescibacteria were abundant in plant samples; Elusimicrobiota and Desulfobacterota were in the rock samples while Nitrospirota, Micrarchaeota, and Deinococcota were dominant in the soil samples. Acidophilic thermophiles were enriched in samples within close proximity to the fumaroles, primarily at a distance of 1 m. The sulfur and iron-oxidizing acidophilic bacterial genera such as Acidothiobacillus and Sulfobacillus were abundant in the rock samples. The thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus and acidophilic bacteria Acidiphilium were abundant in the soil samples. Additionally, Thermosporothrix and Acidothermus were found abundant in the plant samples. The results of the functional annotation indicated that dark sulfur oxidation, iron oxidation, and hydrogen oxidation pathways were abundant in the soil samples up to 1 m from the fumaroles, while methanogenic and fermentation pathways were more prevalent in the soil samples located 10 m from the fumaroles. Interestingly, the results of this study indicated a higher microbial richness and abundance of acidophilic communities in the soils and plants compared to the rocks of the DYK fumarolic geothermal field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The Greater Caucasus is a part of seismically active Alpine–Himalayan orogenic belt and has been a center of significant volcanic activity during the Quaternary period. That led to the formation of the number of hydrothermal habitats, including subterranean thermal aquifers and surface hot springs. However, there are only a limited number of scientific works reporting on the microbial communities of these habitats. Moreover, all these reports concern only studies of specific microbial taxa, carried out using classical cultivation approaches. In this work, we present first culture-independent study of hydrotherms in the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, located in the southern part of the North Caucasus. Using 16S metabarcoding, we analyzed the composition of the microbial communities of two subterranean thermal aquifers and terrestrial hot springs of the Karmadon valley. Analysis of correlations between the chemical composition of water and the representation of key taxa allowed us to identify the key factors determining the formation of microbial communities. In addition, we were able to identify a significant number of highly abundant deep phylogenetic lineages. Our study represents a first glance on the thermophilic microbial communities of the North Caucasus and may serve as a basis for further microbiological studies of the extreme habitats of this region. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {A neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacterium, strain MIZ01T, which was previously isolated from a wetland in Ibaraki, Japan, was taxonomically characterized in detail. Strain MIZ01T was a motile, curved-rod shaped, Gram-stain-negative bacterium. It was able to grow at 10–40 °C (optimally at 30–35 °C) and at pH 5.5–7.0 (optimally at pH 6.0). It grew microaerobically and chemo-lithoautotrophically using thiosulfate, in addition to ferrous iron, as the sole electron donor. Major cellular fatty acids of strain MIZ01T were C16:1 ω7c/C16:1 ω6c and C16:0. The complete genome sequence (2.74 Mbp) was determined, showing that its DNA G+C content was 60.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain MIZ01T belonged to the family Gallionellaceae, class Betaproteobacteria, and was closely related to an isolate tentatively named ‘Sideroxydans lithotrophicus’ ES-1 (98.2% of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Based on its phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, we conclude that strain MIZ01T represents a new genus and species in the family Gallionellaceae for which we propose the name Sideroxyarcus emersonii gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is strain MIZ01T (=JCM 39089T=DSM 111897T). © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Within the extremely thermoacidophilic Sulfolobaceae, the capacity to oxidize iron varies considerably. While some species are prolific iron oxidizers (e.g. Metallosphaera sedula), other species do not oxidize iron at all (e.g. Sulfolobus acidocaldarius). Iron oxidation capacity maps to a genomic locus, referred to previously as the ‘Fox Cluster’, that encodes putative proteins that are mostly unique to the Sulfolobaceae. The role of putative proteins in the Fox Cluster has not been confirmed, but proteomic analysis here of iron-oxidizing membranes from M. sedula indicates that FoxA2 and FoxB (both cytochrome c oxidase-like subunits) and FoxC (CbsA/cytochrome b domain-containing) are essential. Furthermore, comparative genomics (locus organization and gene disruptions) and transcriptomics (polarity effects and differential expression) connect these genomic determinants with disparate iron biooxidation and respiration measurements among Sulfolobaceae species. While numerous homologous proteins can be identified for FoxA in genome databases (COX-like domains are prevalent across all domains of life), few homologues exist for FoxC or for most other Fox Cluster proteins. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest this locus may have existed in early Sulfolobaceae, while the only other close homologues to the locus appear in the recently discovered candidate phylum Marsarchaota. © 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Proteobacteria is one of the largest and phenotypically most diverse divisions within the domain bacteria. Due to the economic importance, this phylum demands an urgent need for a clear and scientifically sound classification system to streamline their characterization. The goal of our study was to carefully reevaluate the current system of classification and suggest changes wherein necessary. Phylogenetic trees of 84 Proteobacteria were constructed using single gene-based phylogeny involving 16S rRNA genes and protein sequences of 85 conserved genes, whole genome-based phylogenetic tree using CVtree3.0, amino acid Identity matrix tree, and concatenated tree with aforementioned conserved genes. The results of our study confirm the polyphyletic relationship between Desulfurella acetivorans, a Deltaproteobacteria with Epsilonproteobacteria. The group Syntrophobacterales was found to be polyphyletic with respect to Desulfarculus baarsii and the group Thiotrichales was found to be splitting in different phylogenetic trees. Placement of phylogenetic groups belonging to Rhodocyclales, Oceonospirilalles, and Chromatiales is controversial and requires further study and revisions. Based on our analysis, we strongly support reclassification of Magnetococcales as a separate class Etaproteobacteria. From our results, we conclude that concatenated trees of conserved proteins are a more accurate method for phylogenetic analysis, as compared to other methods used. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii possesses stress tolerance strategies against host innate immunity and antibiotic killing. However, how the host-pathogen-antibiotic interaction affects the overall molecular regulation of bacterial pathogenesis and host response remains unexplored. Here, we simultaneously investigate proteomic changes in A. baumannii and macrophages following infection in the absence or presence of the polymyxins. We discover that macrophages and polymyxins exhibit complementary effects to disarm several stress tolerance and survival strategies in A. baumannii, including oxidative stress resistance, copper tolerance, bacterial iron acquisition and stringent response regulation systems. Using the spoT mutant strains, we demonstrate that bacterial cells with defects in stringent response exhibit enhanced susceptibility to polymyxin killing and reduced survival in infected mice, compared to the wild-type strain. Together, our findings highlight that better understanding of host-pathogen-antibiotic interplay is critical for optimization of antibiotic use in patients and the discovery of new antimicrobial strategy to tackle multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. © 2022 Kho et al.

	abstract = {The discharging zones of thermal karst caves provide special environmental conditions for bacteria involved in the biogeochemical processes. The taxonomic composition of bacterial communities inhabiting these still active natural habitats is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal and compare the bacterial diversity of upwelling thermal waters, rock surface biofilms, and cave deposits using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Two thermal karst caves formed in carbonate rocks and located at the discharging endpoints of the Transdanubian Range (Hungary) were studied: a sublacustrine spring cave and a phreatic hypogene cave. The results of 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing revealed that almost all samples were dominated by Proteobacteria and/or Epsilonbacteraeota. Other abundant phyla showed habitat-dependent and diverse distributions. Sequences of the thermal waters were mainly associated with different chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (genera Thiovirga, Thiofaba, and Arcobacter in the sublacustrine thermal spring cave, whereas genera Sulfurovum, Sulfuricurvum, and Sulfurifustis were characteristic of the phreatic hypogene thermal cave) in accordance with the difference in environmental parameters. Sequences belonging to ammonia-oxidizing (unclassified Nitrosococcaceae) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira) were characteristic of the hypogene cave. Sequences related to photoautotrophic bacteria from the lake water and chemoheterotrophic bacteria from the sediment were only found in the sublacustrine spring cave samples. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Antarctic active volcanoes can disperse pyroclastic minerals at long distances, transporting nutrients and microorganisms to the surrounding glacial environment. The sedimented volcanic materials – called tephras – may interact with glacier ice and produce a unique environment for microbial life. This study aimed to describe the microbial community structure of an Antarctic glacier ice with tephra layers in terms of its taxonomic and functional diversity. Ice samples from Collins Glacier (King George Island) containing tephra layers of Deception Island volcano were analyzed by a whole shotgun metagenomic approach. Taxonomic analysis revealed a highly diverse community dominated by phyla Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria. The dominant genera were Chitinophaga (13%), Acidobacterium (8%), and Cyanothece (4%), being all of these known to include psychrotolerant and psychrophilic strains. Functional diversity analysis revealed almost complete carbon, nitrogen and sulfur biogeochemical cycles. Carbohydrate metabolism of the ice-tephra community uses both organic and inorganic carbon inputs, where photosynthesis plays an important role through CO2 fixation. Our results also demonstrate a biotechnological potential for this glacial community, with functional annotations for styrene degradation and carotenoid pigment genes. Future metatranscriptomic studies shall further reveal the active strategies and the biotechnology potential of extremophiles from this unique ice-tephra microbial community. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

There are seven chapters for each crop that provide in-depth information on cultivation, genetic improvement, plant protection measures, management of physiological and abiotic stresses along with related genetic markers and biotechnological advances pertaining to these legumes. The chapters present research findings and brief reviews concerning the advances made in the improvement of these legumes. Legumes are utilized as pulses or grains aiding as an important source of protein for both human and animal consumption and also provide raw materials to the food and feed industries. They are also valuable for soil building, improving soil quality and biological nitrogen fixation. Physiology and genetics provide an inimitable source of information on the distinct aspects of basic and applied legume research for general readers, students, academicians and researchers. Arid legumes are crops characterized by inherent features and capabilities to withstand adverse and harsh climatic conditions, significantly replenish the soil, as well as provide protein and micronutrients. Adaptability to several stresses including drought makes them key to agriculture in areas receiving scanty rainfall. This comprehensive book disseminates significant information on the genetic diversity, cultivation, manipulation through mutagenic techniques, molecular biology and other breeding techniques. The book, therefore, is of importance to teachers, researchers and policymakers who are interested to acquire knowledge about moth bean, cowpea and horse gram. It also serves as an additional reading material for MSc and PhD students of agriculture and environmental sciences. The book is also useful to national and international agricultural scientists and policymakers. # The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Bioleaching of metal sulfide ores involves acidophilic microbes that catalyze the chemical dissolution of the metal sulfide bond that is enhanced by attached and planktonic cell mediated oxidation of iron(II)-ions and inorganic sulfur compounds. Leptospirillum spp. often predominate in sulfide mineral-containing environments, including bioheaps for copper recovery from chalcopyrite, as they are effective primary mineral colonizers and oxidize iron(II)-ions efficiently. In this study, we demonstrated a functional diffusible signal factor interspecies quorum sensing signaling mechanism in Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans that produces (Z)-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid when grown with pyrite as energy source. In addition, pure diffusible signal factor and extracts from supernatants of pyrite grown Leptospirillum spp. inhibited biological iron oxidation in various species, and that pyrite grown Leptospirillum cells were less affected than iron grown cells to self inhibition. Finally, transcriptional analyses for the inhibition of iron-grown L. ferriphilum cells due to diffusible signal factor was compared with the response to exposure of cells to N- acyl-homoserine-lactone type quorum sensing signal compounds. The data suggested that Leptospirillum spp. diffusible signal factor production is a strategy for niche protection and defense against other microbes and it is proposed that this may be exploited to inhibit unwanted acidophile species. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The concentrate contained (%) Fe 32.7, Cu 0.7, Ni 2.3, Stotal 20.9, Ssulfide 17, 0.1 g/t Pt, and 1.35 g/t Pd. The bioleaching was performed at 30 and 40◦ C using two different microbial consortia. At 30◦ C, bioleaching was performed using mixed culture including Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans strains isolated from the sample of acid mine drainage from copper–nickel deposit. At 40◦ C, bioleaching was performed using microbial population formed during long-term bioleaching of copper-zinc concentrate at 40◦ C. Bioleaching was performed for 40 days at pulp density of 10% (solid to liquid ratio 1:10). At 30◦ C, 70% Ni and 14% Cu were leached, while 72% Ni and 34% Cu were recovered in the solution at 40◦ C. PGM were extracted from the concentrate and bioleaching residue obtained at 40◦ C by cyanidation. Cyanidation made it possible to extract 5.5% Pt and 17.3% Pd from the concentrate and 37.8% Pt and 87.8% Pd from the bioleaching residue. Thus, it was shown that the concentrate studied might be processed using bioleaching and subsequent cyanidation to extract both non-ferrous metals and PGM. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD) is usually acidic (pH < 4) and contains high concentrations of dissolved metals and metalloids, making AMD a typical representative of extreme environments. Recent studies have shown that microbes play a key role in AMD bioremediation, and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs) from AMD microbes are important resources for the synthesis of antibacterial and anticancer drugs. Here, 179 samples from 13 mineral types were used to analyze the putative novel microorganisms and secondary metabolites in AMD environments. Among 7,007 qualified metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) mined from these datasets, 6,340 MAGs could not be assigned to any GTDB species representative. Overall, 11,856 smBGCs in eight categories were obtained from 7,007 qualified MAGs, and 10,899 smBGCs were identified as putative novel smBGCs. We anticipate that these datasets will accelerate research in the field of AMD bioremediation, aid in the discovery of novel secondary metabolites, and facilitate investigation into gene functions, metabolic pathways, and CNPS cycles in AMD. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Life emerged and diversified in the absence of molecular oxygen. The prevailing anoxia and unique sulfur chemistry in the Paleo-, Meso-, and Neoarchean and early Proterozoic eras may have supported microbial communities that differ from those currently thriving on the earth's surface. Zodletone spring in southwestern Oklahoma represents a unique habitat where spatial sampling could substitute for geological eras namely, from the anoxic, surficial light-exposed sediments simulating a preoxygenated earth to overlaid water column where air exposure simulates oxygen intrusion during the Neoproterozoic era. We document a remarkably diverse microbial community in the anoxic spring sediments, with 340/516 (65.89%) of genomes recovered in a metagenomic survey belonging to 200 bacterial and archaeal families that were either previously undescribed or that exhibit an extremely rare distribution on the current earth. Such diversity is underpinned by the widespread occurrence of sulfite, thiosulfate, tetrathionate, and sulfur reduction and the paucity of sulfate reduction machineries in these taxa. Hence, these processes greatly expand lineages mediating reductive sulfur-cycling processes in the tree of life. An analysis of the overlaying oxygenated water community demonstrated the development of a significantly less diverse community dominated by well-characterized lineages and a prevalence of oxidative sulfur-cycling processes. Such a transition from ancient novelty to modern commonality underscores the profound impact of the great oxygenation event on the earth's surficial anoxic community. It also suggests that novel and rare lineages encountered in current anaerobic habitats could represent taxa that once thrived in an anoxic earth but have failed to adapt to earth's progressive oxygenation.  © 2022 Hahn et al.},

	abstract = {CO2 fixing microorganisms (CFMs) play a crucial role in carbon (C) sequestration in vegetation restricted areas, e.g., under semiarid and arid conditions. The factors controlling the underlying pathways of the CO2 fixation by microorganisms living in soils remain unclear. Here, almost all genes responsible for the eight CO2 fixation pathways in semiarid soil CFMs communities were identified using metagenomic analysis: including the reductive citrate cycle (rTCA), dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle (DC/4-HB), reductive pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin), 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle (3-HP), 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB), C4-dicarboxylic acid, CAM cycle, and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood-Ljungdahl pathway). By tracing the CO2 fixation flux via 13C labeling, it was shown that the CO2 fixation rates increased along the precipitation gradient. The rTCA and 3-HP pathways for CO2 fixing microorganisms were closely associated with 13C incorporation into the soil organic matter under high mean annual precipitation (MAP) (400–600 mm), whereas the Calvin cycle played a vital role in soils under low MAP (<400 mm) conditions. The abundance of the key genes within the C fixing pathways showed that the microbial C accumulation in soils was mainly influenced by the MAP. In semi-arid to semi-humid grassland soils, where CO2 fixation by CFMs provided about 8.1–27 mg C m−2 day−1 input into the ecosystem, we demonstrated that the rTCA, Calvin, and 3-HP cycle were vital to this essential pathway of C sequestration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Halogenated organic compounds are naturally occurring in subsurface environments; however, accumulation of the degradative intermediate cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) at soil and groundwater sites contaminated with xenobiotic chlorinated ethenes is a global environmental and public health issue. Identifying microorganisms capable of cDCE degradation in these environments is of interest because of their potential application to bioremediation techniques. In this study, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the complete genome of Acinetobacter pittii CEP14, a strain isolated from chloroethene-contaminated groundwater, that has demonstrated the ability for aerobic cometabolic degradation of cDCE in the presence of n-hexane, phenol, and toluene. The A. pittii CEP14 genome consists of a 3.93 Mbp-long chromosome (GenBank accession no. CP084921) with a GC content of 38.9% and three plasmids (GenBank accession no. CP084922, CP084923, and CP084924). Gene function was assigned to 83.4% of the 3,930 coding DNA sequences. Functional annotation of the genome revealed that the CEP14 strain possessed all genetic elements to mediate the degradation of a range of aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including n-hexane and phenol. In addition, it harbors gene clusters involved in cytosol detoxification and oxidative stress resistance, which could play a role in the mitigation of toxic chemical intermediates that can arise during the degradation of cDCE. Gene clusters for heavy metal and antibiotic resistance were also identified in the genome of CEP14. These results suggest that CEP14 may be a versatile degrader of xenobiotic compounds and well-adapted to polluted environments, where a combination of heavy metal and organic compound pollution is often found. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {A comparative analysis of toxicities of both arsenic forms (arsenite and arsenate) in the model eukaryotic microorganism Tetrahymena thermophila (ciliate protozoa) has shown the presence of various detoxification mechanisms and cellular effects comparable to those of animal cells under arsenic stress. In the wild type strain SB1969 arsenate is almost 2.5 times more toxic than arsenite. According to the concentration addition model used in binary metallic mixtures their toxicities show an additive effect. Using fluorescent assays and flow cytometry, it has been detected that As(V) generates elevated levels of ROS/RNS compared to As(III). Both produce the same levels of superoxide anion, but As(V) also causes greater increases in hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite. The mitochondrial membrane potential is affected by both As(V) and As(III), and electron microscopy has also revealed that mitochondria are the main target of both arsenic ionic forms. Fusion/fission and swelling mitochondrial and mitophagy, together with macroautophagy, vacuolization and mucocyst extruction are mainly associated to As(V) toxicity, while As(III) induces an extensive lipid metabolism dysfunction (adipotropic effect). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of some genes encoding antioxidant proteins or enzymes has shown that glutathione and thioredoxin metabolisms are involved in the response to arsenic stress. Likewise, the function of metallothioneins seems to be crucial in arsenic detoxification processes, after using both metallothionein knockout and knockdown strains and cells overexpressing metallothionein genes from this ciliate. The analysis of the differential toxicity of As(III) and As(V) shown in this study provides cytological and molecular tools to be used as biomarkers for each of the two arsenic ionic forms. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {It is undeniable that plastics are ubiquitous and a threat to global ecosystems. Plastic waste is transformed into microplastics (MPs) through physical and chemical disruption processes within the aquatic environment. MPs are detected in almost every environment due to their worldwide transportability through ocean currents or wind, which allows them to reach even the most remote regions of our planet. MPs colonized by biofilm-forming microbial communities are known as the ‘‘plastisphere”. The revelation that this unique substrate can aid microbial dispersal has piqued interest in the ground of microbial ecology. MPs have synergetic effects on the development, transportation, persistence, and ecology of microorganisms. This review summarizes the studies of plastisphere in recent years and the microbial community assemblage (viz. autotrophs, heterotrophs, predators, and pathogens). We also discussed plastic-microbe interactions and the potential sources of plastic degrading microorganisms.

	abstract = {A biofilm is a community of stable microorganisms encapsulated in an extracellular matrix produced by themselves. Many types of microorganisms that are found on living hosts or in the environment can form biofilms. These include pathogenic bacteria that can serve as a reservoir for persistent infections, and are culpable for leading to a broad spectrum of chronic illnesses and emergence of antibiotic resistance making them difficult to be treated. The absence of biofilm-targeting antibiotics in the drug discovery pipeline indicates an unmet opportunity for designing new biofilm inhibitors as antimicrobial agents using various strategies and targeting distinct stages of biofilm formation. The strategies available to control biofilm formation include targeting the enzymes and proteins specific to the microorganism and those involved in the adhesion pathways leading to formation of resistant biofilms. This review primarily focuses on the recent strategies and advances responsible for identifying a myriad of antibiofilm agents and their mechanism of biofilm inhibition, including extracellular polymeric substance synthesis inhibitors, adhesion inhibitors, quorum sensing inhibitors, efflux pump inhibitors, and cyclic diguanylate inhibitors. Furthermore, we present the structure–activity relationships (SAR) of these agents, including recently discovered biofilm inhibitors, nature-derived bioactive scaffolds, synthetic small molecules, antimicrobial peptides, bioactive compounds isolated from fungi, non-proteinogenic amino acids and antibiotics. We hope to fuel interest and focus research efforts on the development of agents targeting the uniquely complex, physical and chemical heterogeneous biofilms through a multipronged approach and combinatorial therapeutics for a more effective control and management of biofilms across diseases. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {This report focuses on a facile and one-pot way to synthesize stable Cu nanoparticles (NPs) through a bacterial approach using an inexpensive and non-toxic copper salt in the aqueous solution. Copper NPs were obtained from an extracellular enzymatic metal-reduction process via bacterial strains PN14F and B3 which were similar with Bacillus haynesii (99.87%) and Bacillus halotolerans (100%), respectively, on the basis of phylogenic analysis. It was found that Cu NPs were formed in the cell-free culture liquid but not in the fresh biomass medium, so that it was hypothesized that an extracellular compound was responsible for the proceeding. According to the spectroscopic data, the NPs can bind to the proteins through their free amine or carboxylate groups. It is noteworthy that by varying the bacterial supernatant, the remarkable changes occur in the size and morphology of copper NPs, where their thickness and diameter are observed to be 2–30 and 1–15 nm in the presence of bacterial strains PN14F and B3, respectively. It is noticeable that this manner is a novel, green, eco-friendly and suitable method for large-scale production. Finally, the as-made Cu NPs showed antibacterial activity against B. Subtilis, in which a significant decrease was observed in its growth. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cueva de la Mora is a permanently stratified acidic pit lake with extremely high concentrations of heavy metals at depth. In order to evaluate the potential for in situ sulfide production, we characterized the microbial community in the deep layer using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. We retrieved 18 high quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) representing the most abundant populations. None of the MAGs were closely related to either cultured or non-cultured organisms from the Genome Taxonomy or NCBI databases (none with average nucleotide identity >95%). Despite oxygen concentrations that are consistently below detection in the deep layer, some archaeal and bacterial MAGs mapped transcripts of genes for sulfide oxidation coupled with oxygen reduction. Among these microaerophilic sulfide oxidizers, mixotrophic Thermoplasmatales archaea were the most numerous and represented 24% of the total community. Populations associated with the highest predicted in situ activity for sulfate reduction were affiliated with Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Nitrospirae phyla, and together represented about 9% of the total community. These MAGs, in addition to a less abundant Proteobacteria MAG in the genus Desulfomonile, contained transcripts of genes in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. All MAGs had significant genetic potential for organic carbon oxidation. Our results indicate that novel acidophiles are contributing to biosulfidogenesis in the deep layer of Cueva de la Mora, and that in situ sulfide production is limited by organic carbon availability and sulfur oxidation.

	abstract = {Comamonas spp. are Gram-negative bacteria that catabolize a wide range of organic and inorganic substrates. Comamonas spp. are abundant in aquatic and soil environments, including wastewater, and can cause opportunistic infections in humans. Because of their potential in wastewater bioaugmentation and bioremediation strategies, the identification of Comamonas species harboring genes encoding carbapenemases and other clinically important antibiotic resistance genes warrant further investigation. Here, we present an analysis of 39 whole-genome sequences comprising three Comamonas species from aquatic environments in South Australia that were recovered on media supplemented with carbapenems. The analysis includes a detailed description of 33 Comamonas denitrificans isolates, some of which carried chromosomally acquired blaGES-5, blaOXA, and aminoglycoside resistance (aadA) genes located on putative genomic islands (GIs). All blaGES-5- and blaOXA-containing GIs appear to be unique to this Australian collection of C. denitrificans. Notably, most open reading frames (ORFs) within the GIs, including all antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, had adjacent attC sites, indicating that these ORFs are mobile gene cassettes. One C. denitrificans isolate carried an IncP-1 plasmid with genes involved in xenobiotic degradation and response to oxidative stress. Our assessment of the sequences highlights the very distant nature of C. denitrificans to the other Comamonas species and its apparent disposition to acquire antimicrobial resistance genes on putative genomic islands. © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {The goal of this work was to study the bioleaching of arsenic-containing polymetallic concentrate that contained 6.2% Cu, 7.3% Zn and 1.7% As, depending on different temperatures and in the presence of CO2 and molasses in the medium, as well as the difference in the composition of microbial population formed under various conditions. A mixed population of moderately thermophilic and thermotolerant acidophilic microorganisms formed during the continuous bioleaching of copper concentrate was used as an inoculum. The experiments were carried out in a continuous mode in laboratory scale reactors, with a temperature range of 40 °C to 60 °C. To assess the effect of CO2 and molasses on metal leaching and microbial population composition, the experiments were carried out in three reactors: CO2 (~0.01 L/min) was supplied into the first reactor; 0.02% molasses were added to the pulp of the second reactor; and no additional carbon sources were supplied into the control reactor. The highest copper recovery (27%) was achieved at 50°C in the experiment with molasses, while the highest zinc recovery (82.1%) was reached at 45°C in the control experiment. Additional carbon sources affected the extraction of non-ferrous metals only at 60 °C and increased the extraction of copper and zinc by 12.6% and 24.2%, respectively. Both the temperature and carbon source used affected the microbial population composition. The main microbial genera revealed in the populations by next generation sequencing (NGS) were bacteria of the genera Sulfobacillus and Acidithiobacillus, as well as archaea of the genera Ferroplasma, Acidiplasma, and Cuniculiplasma. At low temperatures (40 and 45 °C), Acidithiobacillus, Sulfobacillus, and Ferroplasma predominated, while at temperatures 50–55 °C, the decrease in relative abundance of these genera occurred, and the predominance of Acidiplasma archaea was observed. The usage of both CO2 and molasses led to the increase in Sulfobacillus and Acidiplasma in relative abundance. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In acid drainage environments, biosulfidogenesis by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) attenuates the extreme conditions by enabling the precipitation of metals as their sulfides, and the neutralization of acidity through proton consumption. So far, only a handful of moderately acidophilic SRB species have been described, most of which are merely acidotolerant. Here, a novel species within a novel genus of moderately acidophilic SRB is described, Acididesulfobacillus acetoxydans gen. nov. sp. nov. strain INE, able to grow at pH 3.8. Bioreactor studies with strain INE at optimum (5.0) and low (3.9) pH for growth showed that strain INE alkalinized its environment, and that this was more pronounced at lower pH. These studies also showed the capacity of strain INE to completely oxidize organic acids to CO2, which is uncommon among acidophilic SRB. Since organic acids are mainly in their protonated form at low pH, which increases their toxicity, their complete oxidation may be an acid stress resistance mechanism. Comparative proteogenomic and membrane lipid analysis further indicated that the presence of saturated ether-bound lipids in the membrane, and their relative increase at lower pH, was a protection mechanism against acid stress. Interestingly, other canonical acid stress resistance mechanisms, such as a Donnan potential and increased active charge transport, did not appear to be active.

	abstract = {Terrestrial life is currently the only known example of life in the Universe. However, improved techniques in the fields of molecular biology, microbiology, and biogeochemistry have greatly expanded our knowledge of the limits of life, enabling the study of life in "extreme" habitats that bear close resemblance to conditions found elsewhere in our solar system. Using these metrics, we may better focus future life-detection efforts, and identify processes and products of life on Earth that may be used as indicators of life on other worlds. We review here the advances which have birthed some of the primary “omics” disciplines: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics. We provide an overview of what each of these disciplines can and cannot offer, and the opportunities and challenges of applying omics techniques to life detection beyond Earth. While life on other worlds may not resemble life as we currently know it, we may yet learn a great deal about the boundary conditions of living systems by studying the vast array of biological molecules formed by life on Earth. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Virus-borne auxiliary genes have been demonstrated to influence their hosts’ characteristics and flexibility, resulting in an elevated ability to withstand diverse conditions and competition. However, the research on the soil viral community and its influencing factors is not extensive. The effects of bacterium-phage co-evolution in the metal contaminated environment have yet to be fully understood. In our research, numerous viral genes with conserved functional residues/motifs working on detoxifying heavy metals were pinpointed in the virome recovered from 58 contaminated soil metagenomic samples of mineral area, including tellurite resistance genes (e.g., terC, terD), copper resistance genes (e.g., copC, copA), and arsenate resistance genes (e.g., arsC). Moreover, viral proteins involved in key processes of nutrient uptake and metabolism, cellular function, polysaccharides production and biomineralization were also detected, which may also contribute to the response of microbial community to heavy metal stress. Our research showed that viruses have helped their hosts to acquire novel metal-resistance abilities through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) during the adaptation to challenging metal-rich environments. This was also evidenced by the high Codon adaption index (CAI) values across metal-resistance-related genes. This study has advanced our understanding on virus-host interplay within heavy metal contaminated soils. Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Huang, Zeng, Xiao, Zhu, Kong, Zou, Liu and Yin.},

BJC16-A38T exhibited phenanthrene biodegradation activity that can degrade 88.02% phenanthrene in the MM medium after 7 days cultivation. Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic and genomic characteristics concluded that strain BJC16-A38T represents a novel species of the genus Mucilaginibacter. Hence, the name Mucilaginibacter phenanthrenivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BJC16-A38T (= CGMCC 1.12693T = NBRC 110383T). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities have been explored in various terrestrial subsurface ecosystems, showing metabolic potentials that could generate noteworthy morphological and molecular biosignatures. Recent advancements in bioinformatic tools have allowed for descriptions of novel and yet-to-be cultivated microbial lineages in different ecosystems due to the genome reconstruction approach from metagenomic data. Using shotgun metagenomic data, we obtained metagenome-assembled genomes related to cultivated and yet-to-be cultivated prokaryotic lineages from a silica and iron-rich cave (Monte Cristo) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The Monte Cristo Cave has been shown to possess a high diversity of genes involved with different biogeochemical cycles, including reductive and oxidative pathways related to carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and iron. Three genomes were selected for pangenomic analysis, assigned as Truepera sp., Ca. Methylomirabilis sp., and Ca. Koribacter sp. based on their lifestyles (radiation resistance, anaerobic methane oxidation, and potential iron oxidation). These bacteria exhibit genes involved with multiple DNA repair strategies, starvation, and stress response. Because these groups have few reference genomes deposited in databases, our study adds important genomic information about these lineages. The combination of techniques applied in this study allowed us to unveil the potential relationships between microbial genomes and their ecological processes with the cave mineralogy and highlight the lineages involved with anaerobic methane oxidation, iron oxidation, and radiation resistance as functional models for the search for extant life-forms outside our planet in silica-and iron-rich environments and potentially on Mars. © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.},

	abstract = {Acidiferrobacter spp. are facultatively anaerobic acidophiles that belong to a distinctive Acidiferrobacteraceae family, which are similar to Ectothiorhodospiraceae phylogenetically, and are closely related to Acidithiobacillia class/subdivision physiologically. The limited genome information has kept them from being studied on molecular taxonomy and environmental adaptation in depth. Herein, Af. thiooxydans ZJ was isolated from acid mine drainage (AMD), and the complete genome sequence was reported to scan its genetic constitution for taxonomic and adaptative feature exploration. The genome has a single chromosome of 3,302,271 base pairs (bp), with a GC content of 63.61%. The phylogenetic tree based on OrthoANI highlighted the unique position of Af. thiooxydans ZJ, which harbored more unique genes among the strains from Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Acidithiobacillaceae by pan-genome analysis. The diverse mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as insertion sequence (IS), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR), prophage, and genomic island (GI), have been identified and characterized in Af. thiooxydans ZJ. The results showed that Af. thiooxydans ZJ may effectively resist the infection of foreign viruses and gain functional gene fragments or clusters to shape its own genome advantageously. This study will offer more evidence of the genomic plasticity and improve our understanding of evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to extreme AMD environment, which could expand the potential utilization of Af. thiooxydans ZJ as an iron and sulfur oxidizer in industrial bioleaching.

	abstract = {Microbial electrocatalysis reckons on microbes as catalysts for reactions occurring at electrodes. Microbial fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells are well-known in this context; both prefer the oxidation of organic and inorganic matter for producing electricity. Notably, the synthesis of high energy-density chemicals (fuels) or their precursors by microorganisms using bio-cathode to yield electrical energy is called Microbial Electrosynthesis (MES), giving an exceptionally appealing novel way for producing beneficial products from electricity and wastewater. This review accentuates the concept, importance and opportunities of MES, as an emerging discipline at the nexus of microbiology and electrochemistry. Production of organic compounds from MES is considered as an effective technique for the generation of various beneficial reduced end-products (like acetate and butyrate) as well as in reducing the load of CO2 from the atmosphere to mitigate the harmful effect of greenhouse gases in global warming. Although MES is still an emerging technology, this method is not thoroughly known. The authors have focused on MES, as it is the next transformative, viable alternative technology to decrease the repercussions of surplus carbon dioxide in the environment along with conserving energy. © 2021 by the authors.

Compared with the condition of pH 7.2, 228 proteins in pH 5.0 and 93 proteins in pH 8.5 were identified as differentially accumulated proteins. The results further showed that in the condition of pH 5.0, fourteen chemotaxis-related proteins, two uptake-related proteins, two cytochromes, nineteen ABC transporters and five porins were downregulated, while two dioxygenases, five β-oxidation-related proteins and one acyl-CoA metabolism-related protein were upregulated. In the condition of pH 8.5, one fimbrial protein, one aldehyde dehydrogenase, eight ABC transporters and six porins were downregulated, while five terminal oxidation-related proteins, one alcohol dehydrogenase, one β-oxidation-related protein and one acyl-CoA metabolism-related protein were upregulated. The results indicated that in the condition of pH 5.0, chemotaxis and uptake of carbon, terminal oxidation of short-chain alkanes and transmembrane transport which are considered as key cellular processes in biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in P.aeruginosa P6 may be disturbed. While in the condition of pH 8.5, the activity of transmembrane transport may decrease. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The KTK 4A-related Thermoplasmata thrives in the sediment of saline lakes; however, systematic research on its taxonomy, environmental adaptation and metabolism is lacking. Here, we detected this abundant lineage in the sediment of five artificially separated ponds (salinity 7.0%–33.0%) within a Chinese soda-saline lake using culture-independent metagenomics and archaeal 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The phylogenies based on the 16S rRNA gene, and 122 archaeal ubiquitous single-copy proteins and genome-level identity analyses among the metagenome-assembled genomes demonstrate this lineage forming a novel order, Candidatus Haloplasmatales, comprising four genera affiliated with the identical family. Isoelectric point profiles of predicted proteomes suggest that most members adopt the energetically favourable ‘salt-in’ strategy. Functional prediction indicates the lithoheterotrophic nature with the versatile metabolic potentials for carbohydrate and organic acids as well as carbon monoxide and hydrogen utilization. Additionally, hydrogenase genes hdrABC-mvhADG are linked with incomplete reductive citrate cycle genes in the genomes, suggesting their functional connection. Comparison with the coupling of HdrABC-MvhADG and methanogenesis pathway provides new insights into the compatibility of laterally acquired methanogenesis with energy metabolism in the related order Methanomassiliicoccales. Globally, our research sheds light on the taxonomy, environmental adaptative mechanisms, metabolic potentials and evolutional significance of Ca.

	abstract = {Sulphur compounds are used in a variety of biological processes including respiration and photosynthesis. Sulphide and sulphur compounds of intermediary oxidation state can serve as electron donors for lithotrophic growth while sulphate, thiosulphate and sulphur are used as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration. The biochemistry underlying the manifold transformations of inorganic sulphur compounds occurring in sulphur metabolizing prokaryotes is astonishingly complex and knowledge about it has immensely increased over the last years. The advent of next-generation sequencing approaches as well as the significant increase of data availability in public databases has driven focus of environmental microbiology to probing the metabolic capacity of microbial communities by analysis of this sequence data. To facilitate these analyses, we created HMS-S-S, a comprehensive equivalogous hidden Markov model (HMM)-supported tool. Protein sequences related to sulphur compound oxidation, reduction, transport and intracellular transfer are efficiently detected and related enzymes involved in dissimilatory sulphur oxidation as opposed to sulphur compound reduction can be confidently distinguished. HMM search results are coupled to corresponding genes, which allows analysis of co-occurrence, synteny and genomic neighbourhood. The HMMs were validated on an annotated test data set and by cross-validation. We also proved its performance by exploring meta-assembled genomes isolated from samples from environments with active sulphur cycling, including members of the cable bacteria, novel Acidobacteria and assemblies from a sulphur-rich glacier, and were able to replicate and extend previous reports. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Enterococcus faecalis is often coisolated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in polymicrobial biofilm-associated infections of wounds and the urinary tract. As a defense strategy, the host innately restricts iron availability at infection sites. Despite their coprevalence, the polymicrobial interactions of these two species in biofilms and under iron-restricted conditions remain unexplored. Here, we show that E. faecalis inhibits P. aeruginosa growth within biofilms when iron is restricted. E. faecalis lactate dehydrogenase (ldh1) gives rise to L-lactate production during fermentative growth. We find that an E. faecalis ldh1 mutant fails to inhibit P. aeruginosa growth. Additionally, we demonstrate that ldh1 expression is induced under iron-restricted conditions, resulting in increased lactic acid exported and, consequently, a reduction in local environmental pH. Together, our results suggest that E. faecalis synergistically inhibits P. aeruginosa growth by decreasing environmental pH and L-lactate-mediated iron chelation. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of the microenvironment in polymicrobial interactions and how manipulating the microenvironment can impact the growth trajectory of bacterial communities. IMPORTANCE Many infections are polymicrobial and biofilm-associated in nature. Iron is essential for many metabolic processes and plays an important role in controlling infections, where the host restricts iron as a defense mechanism against invading pathogens. However, polymicrobial interactions between pathogens are underexplored under ironrestricted conditions. Here, we explore the polymicrobial interactions between commonly coisolated E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa within biofilms. We find that E. faecalis modulates the microenvironment by exporting lactic acid which further chelates already limited iron and also lowers the environmental pH to antagonize P. aeruginosa growth under iron-restricted conditions. Our findings provide insights into polymicrobial interactions between bacteria and how manipulating the microenvironment can be taken advantage of to better control infections.  © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Gallium (Ga) is considered a high-tech Critical Metal, used in the manufacture of several microelectronic components containing either gallium arsenide (GaAs) or gallium nitride (GaN). The current high demand for this critical metal urges the development of effective recovery processes from secondary resources such as mine tailings or electronic recycling material. The importance of bioleaching as a biotechnological process to recover metals prompted this study, where an integrative approach combining experimental and genomic analysis was undertaken to identify potential mechanisms involved in bioleaching ability and strategies to cope with high metal(loid)s concentrations in five mine isolates. The Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) annotation showed that the “amino acid transport and metabolism” [E] was the most predominant functional category in all genomes. In addition, the KEEG pathways analysis also showed predicted genes for the biosynthetic pathways of most amino acids, indicating that amino acids could have an important role in the Ga leaching mechanism. The presence of effective resistance mechanisms to Ga and arsenic (As) was particularly important in GaAs bioleaching batch assays, and might explain the divergence in bioleaching efficiency among the bacterial strains. Rhodanobacter sp. B2A1Ga4 and Sphingomonas sp. A2-49 with higher resistance, mainly to As, were the most efficient bioleaching strains under these conditions. In bioleaching assays using cell-free spent medium Arthrobacter silviterrae A2-55 with lower As resistance outperformed all the other stains. Overall, higher efficiency in Ga leaching was obtained in bioleaching assays using GaAs when compared to GaN. Copyright © 2022 Chung, Francisco, Morais and Branco.},

	abstract = {Karst ecosystems represent up to 25% of the land surface and recent studies highlight their potential role as a sink for atmospheric methane. Despite this, there is limited knowledge of the diversity and distribution of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) or methanogens in karst caves and the sub-surface environment in general. Here, we performed a survey of 14 shotgun metagenomes from cave ecosystems covering a broad set of environmental conditions, to compare the relative abundance and phylogenetic diversity of MOB and methanogens, targeting biomarker genes for methane monooxygenase (pmoA and mmoX) and methyl-coenzyme M reductase (mcrA). Taxonomic analysis of metagenomes showed 0.02–1.28% of classified reads were related to known MOB, of which Gammaproteobacterial MOB were the most abundant making up on average 70% of the surveyed caves’ MOB community. Potential for biogenic methane production in caves was also observed, with 0.008–0.39% of reads classified to methanogens and was dominated by sequences related to Methanosarcina. We have also generated a cave ecosystems protein database (CEPD) based on protein level assembly of cave metagenomes that can be used to profile genes of interest.

	abstract = {Autotrophic acidophilic bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a model species for studying metal bioleaching from low-grade sulfide ores and concentrates. Arsenopyrite gold-bearing concentrates are refractory and often processed using biohydrometallurgical approaches; therefore, it is important to develop methods to improve arsenopyrite bioleaching. In the present work, we have studied the possibility of improving arsenopyrite concentrate bioleaching by the strain of A. ferrooxidans. For this purpose, we have analyzed the genome of the strain A. ferrooxidans TFBk to reveal the genes potentially important in the bioleaching process. Genes determining resistance to arsenic, as well genes involved in the utilization of C1-compounds and resistance to oxidative stress, were revealed. Therefore, the possibility of increasing the rate of arsenopyrite concentrate bioleaching using C1-compounds (methanol and formate) was studied. Formate was able to increase both the biomass yield of the strain A. ferrooxidans TFBk as well as the bioleaching rate. In addition, the effect of redox potential increase by means of the addition of sodium persulfate in the medium on arsenopyrite concentrate bioleaching was studied. It was shown that the addition of 0.1% sodium persulfate stimulated strain growth, while a higher concentration inhibited it. Despite this, the rate of concentrate bioleaching increased in the presence of 0.5–1.0% of persulfate, which may be explained by the interactions of added oxidizer with concentrate components. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are growth-controlling genetic elements consisting of an intracellular toxin protein and its cognate antitoxin. TA systems have been spread among microbial genomes through horizontal gene transfer and are now prevalent in most bacterial and archaeal genomes. Under normal growth conditions, antitoxins tightly counteract the activity of the toxins. Upon stresses, antitoxins are inactivated, releasing activated toxins, which induce growth arrest or cell death. In this study, among nine functional TA modules in Bosea sp. PAMC 26642 living in Arctic lichen, we investigated the functionality of BoHigBA2. BohigBA2 is located close to a genomic island and adjacent to flagellar gene clusters. The expression of BohigB2 induced the inhibition of E. coli growth at 37°C, which was more manifest at 18°C, and this growth defect was reversed when BohigA2 was co-expressed, suggesting that this BoHigBA2 module might be an active TA module in Bosea sp. PAMC 26642. Live/dead staining and viable count analyses revealed that the BoHigB2 toxin had a bactericidal effect, causing cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BoHigB2 possessed mRNA-specific ribonuclease activity on various mRNAs and cleaved only mRNAs being translated, which might impede overall translation and consequently lead to cell death. Our study provides the insight to understand the cold adaptation of Bosea sp. PAMC 26642 living in the Arctic. © 2022, The Microbiological Society of Korea.},

	abstract = {The genome streamlining theory suggests that reduction of microbial genome size optimizes energy utilization in stressful environments. Although this hypothesis has been explored in several cases of low-nutrient (oligotrophic) and high-temperature environments, little work has been carried out on microorganisms from low-pH environments, and what has been reported is inconclusive. In this study, we performed a large-scale comparative genomics investigation of more than 260 bacterial high-quality genome sequences of acidophiles, together with genomes of their closest phylogenetic relatives that live at circum-neutral pH. A statistically supported correlation is reported between reduction of genome size and decreasing pH that we demonstrate is due to gene loss and reduced gene sizes. This trend is independent from other genome size constraints such as temperature and G + C content. Genome streamlining in the evolution of acidophilic bacteria is thus supported by our results. The analyses of predicted Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) categories and subcellular location predictions indicate that acidophiles have a lower representation of genes encoding extracellular proteins, signal transduction mechanisms, and proteins with unknown function but are enriched in inner membrane proteins, chaperones, basic metabolism, and core cellular functions. Contrary to other reports for genome streamlining, there was no significant change in paralog frequencies across pH. However, a detailed analysis of COG categories revealed a higher proportion of genes in acidophiles in the following categories: “replication and repair,” “amino acid transport,” and “intracellular trafficking”. This study brings increasing clarity regarding the genomic adaptations of acidophiles to life at low pH while putting elements, such as the reduction of average gene size, under the spotlight of streamlining theory.

	abstract = {The present study aimed to predict differential enrichment of pathways and compounds in the rhizosphere microbiomes of the two wild plants (Abutilon fruticosum and Nitrosalsola vermiculata) and to predict functional shifts in microbiomes due to water. Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA region V3–V4 was done and gene-based microbial compositions were enrolled in PICRUSt to predict enriched pathways and compounds. The results indicated that “ABC transporters” and “Quorum sensing” pathways are among the highest enriched pathways in rhizosphere microbiomes of the two wild plants compared with those of the bulk soil microbiomes. The highest enriched compounds in soil microbiomes of the two wild plants included five proteins and three enzymes participating in one or more KEGG pathways. Six of these eight compounds showed higher predicted enrichment in rhizosphere soil microbiomes, while only one, namely phosphate transport system substrate-binding protein, showed higher enrichment in the surrounding bulk soil microbiomes. In terms of differentially enriched compounds due to watering, only the dual-specific aspartyl-tRNA (Asn)/glutamyl-tRNA (Gln) amidotransferase subunit A showed higher enrichment in rhizosphere soil of the two wild plants after 24 h of watering. Two of the highly enriched compounds namely branched-chain amino acid transport system ATP-binding protein and branched-chain amino acid transport system substrate-binding protein, are encoded by genes stimulated by the plant’s GABA that participates in conferring biotic and abiotic stresses in plants and improves the plant’s growth performance. The 3-Oxoacyl-[ACP] reductase, a member of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/ reductase (SDR) superfamily, participates in fatty acids elongation cycles and contributes to plant-microbe symbiotic relationships, while enoyl-CoA hydratase has a reverse action as it participates in “Fatty acid degradation” pathway. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein is an environmental signal that sense “Bacterial chemotaxis” pathway to help establishing symbiosis with plant roots by recruiting/colonizing of microbial partners (symbionts) to plant rhizosphere. This information justifies the high enrichment of compounds in plant rhizosphere. The dual-specific aspartyl-tRNA (Asn)/glutamyl-tRNA (Gln) amidotransferase subunit A contributes to the plant ability to respond to watering as it participates in attaching the correct amino acid during translation to its cognate tRNA species, while hydrolyzing incorrectly attached amino acid. These two actions reduce the influence of oxidative stress in generating misfolded proteins and in reducing fidelity of translation. © 2022, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) is one of the typical representatives of deep-sea ultraslow-spreading ridges, and has increasingly become a hot spot of studying subsurface geological activities and deep-sea mining management. However, the understanding of microbial activities is still limited on active hydrothermal vent chimneys in SWIR. In this study, samples from an active black smoker and a diffuse vent located in the Longqi hydrothermal region were collected for deep metagenomic sequencing, which yielded approximately 290 GB clean data and 295 mid-to-high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Sulfur oxidation conducted by a variety of Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Campylobacterota was presumed to be the major energy source for chemosynthesis in Longqi hydrothermal vents. Diverse iron-related microorganisms were recovered, including iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria, iron-reducing Deferrisoma, and magnetotactic bacterium. Twenty-two bacterial MAGs from 12 uncultured phyla harbored iron oxidase Cyc2 homologs and enzymes for organic carbon degradation, indicated novel chemolithoheterotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria that affected iron biogeochemistry in hydrothermal vents. Meanwhile, potential interactions between microbial communities and chimney minerals were emphasized as enriched metabolic potential of siderophore transportation, and extracellular electron transfer functioned by multi-heme proteins was discovered. Composition of chimney minerals probably affected microbial iron metabolic potential, as pyrrhotite might provide more available iron for microbial communities. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into microbial activities and potential mineral-microorganism interactions in hydrothermal vents. Copyright © 2022 Zhong et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Terrestrial hot spring settings span a broad spectrum of physicochemistries. Physicochemical parameters, such as pH and temperature, are key factors influencing differences in microbial composition across diverse geothermal areas. Nonetheless, analysis of hot spring pools from the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand, revealed that some members of the bacterial genus, Acidithiobacillus, are prevalent across wide ranges of hot spring pHs and temperatures. To determine the genomic attributes of Acidithiobacillus that inhabit such diverse conditions, we assembled the genomes of 19 uncultivated hot spring Acidithiobacillus strains from six geothermal areas and compared these to 37 publicly available Acidithiobacillus genomes from various habitats. Results: Analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 138 samples revealed that Acidithiobacillus comprised on average 11.4 ± 16.8% of hot spring prokaryotic communities, with three Acidithiobacillus amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) (TVZ_G1, TVZ_G2, TVZ_G3) accounting for > 90% of Acidithiobacillus in terms of relative abundance, and occurring in 126 out of 138 samples across wide ranges of temperature (17.5–92.9 °C) and pH (1.0–7.5). We recovered 19 environmental genomes belonging to each of these three ASVs, as well as a fourth related group (TVZ_G4). Based on genome average nucleotide identities, the four groups (TVZ_G1-TVZ_G4) constitute distinct species (ANI < 96.5%) of which three are novel Acidithiobacillus species (TVZ_G2-TVZ_G4) and one belongs to Acidithiobacillus caldus (TVZ_G1). All four TVZ Acidithiobacillus groups were found in hot springs with temperatures above the previously known limit for the genus (up to 40 °C higher), likely due to significantly higher proline and GC contents than other Acidithiobacillus species, which are known to increase thermostability. Results also indicate hot spring-associated Acidithiobacillus have undergone genome streamlining, likely due to thermal adaptation. Moreover, our data suggest that Acidithiobacillus prevalence across varied hot spring pHs is supported by distinct strategies, whereby TVZ_G2-TVZ_G4 regulate pH homeostasis mostly through Na+/H+ antiporters and proton-efflux ATPases, whereas TVZ_G1 mainly relies on amino acid decarboxylases. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the distribution of Acidithiobacillus species across diverse hot spring physichochemistries and determines genomic features and adaptations that potentially enable Acidithiobacillus species to colonize a broad range of temperatures and pHs in geothermal environments.

	abstract = {Introduction: The intestinal microbiota acts as an additional “organ” that performs a variety of fu\nctions for the host’s health. However, the composition and role of the intestinal microbiota in Scylla paramamosain cultivated in inland low salinity saline-alkaline water are unknown. Methods: Accordingly, from the perspective of practical production, we explored the intestinal microbiota communities and the critical bacteria of S. paramamosain in normal salinity seawater (NS), coastal low salinity seawater (CS), acute low salinity seawater (AS) and inland low salinity saline-alkaline water (IS). Results: Results showed that there were significant differences in the diversity composition of intestinal microbiota and the relative abundance of dominant taxa in each group of cultured crabs. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota and Campilobacterota were shown to be the major phyla shared by the four groups, with Bacteroidota having the highest relative abundance (27.10%) in the inland low salinity saline-alkaline water group (IS). Fusobacteriota had the highest proportion in IS group compared with other low salinity groups. A total of 284 indicator bacteria were identified, belonging to eight phyla, and their relative abundances were varied significantly (P < 0.05). Genus Carboxylicivirga, as the indicator bacterium of the IS group, may play a critical role in the adaptation of crab to saline-alkaline water environment. Moreover, salinity may exert considerable selective pressure on the entire microbial community. Discussion: These findings revealed the features of the intestinal microbiome in S. paramamosain in multiple low salinity patterns, and provided candidate probiotics and basic information for crab farming in saline-alkaline water, which was conducive to the development and perfection of mud crab culturing technology in inland low salinity saline-alkaline water.

	abstract = {Iron(II) [Fe(II)] oxidation coupled to denitrification is recognized as an environmentally important process in many ecosystems. However, the Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) dominating autotrophic nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing enrichment cultures, affiliated with the family Gallionellaceae, remain poorly taxonomically defined due to lack of representative isolates. We describe the taxonomic classification of three novel FeOB based on metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) acquired from the autotrophic nitrate-reducing enrichment cultures KS, BP and AG. Phylogenetic analysis of nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that these three FeOB were most closely affiliated to the genera Ferrigenium, Sideroxydans and Gallionella, with up to 96.5%, 95.4% and 96.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence identities to representative isolates of these genera, respectively. In addition, average amino acid identities (AAI) of the genomes compared to the most closely related genera revealed highest AAI with Ferrigenium kumadai An22 (76.35–76.74%), suggesting that the three FeOB are members of this genus. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved functional genes further supported that these FeOB represent three novel species of the genus Ferrigenium. Moreover, the three novel FeOB likely have characteristic features, performing partial denitrification coupled to Fe(II) oxidation and carbon fixation. Scanning electron microscopy of the enrichment cultures showed slightly curved rod-shaped cells, ranging from 0.2-0.7 μm in width and 0.5–2.3 μm in length. Based on the phylogenetic, genomic and physiological characteristics, we propose that these FeOB represent three novel species, ‘Candidatus Ferrigenium straubiae’ sp. nov., ‘Candidatus Ferrigenium bremense’ sp. nov. and ‘Candidatus Ferrigenium altingense’ sp. nov. that might have unique metabolic features among the genus Ferrigenium. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Microalgae as an alternative renewable resource for biofuel production have captured much significance. Nonetheless, its economic viability is a field of major concern for researchers. Unraveling the lipid catabolic pathway and gaining insights into the sequence-structural features of its primary functioning enzyme, Triacylglycerol lipase, will impart valuable information to target microalgae for augmented lipid content. In the present study, a genome-wide comparative study on putative Triacylglycerol lipase (TAGL) enzyme from algal species belonging to varied phylogenetic lineages was performed. The comprehensive sequence analysis revealed that TAGL comprises of three distinct conserved domains, such as, Patatin, Class III Lipase, and Abhydro_lipase, and also confirmed the ubiquitous presence of GXSXG motif in the sequences analyzed. In the absence of a crystal structure of algal TAGL till date, we developed the first 3D model of patatin domain of TAGL from an oleaginous microalga, Phaedactylum tricornutum, employing homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamic simulations methods. The domain-substrate complex having the low-ranking docking score revealed the binding of palmitic acid to the TAGL patatin domain surface with strong hydrogen bond interactions. The simulation results implied that the substrate-complexed patatin domain and the free enzyme adopted a more stable conformation after 40 ns. This is the first ever attempt to provide in-silico insights into the structural and dynamical insights on catalytic mechanism of the TAGL patatin domain. Subsequently, these findings aided our understanding on their structural stability, folding mechanism and protein-substrate interactions, which could be further utilized to design site-specific mutagenic experiments for engineering microalgal strains.

Previous studies have described its poly-extreme conditions and its bacterial composition, although the functional features of the complete microbiome have not been characterized yet. By using metabarcoding analysis, metagenomics, metabolomics and enzymology techniques, the microbiome of the crater lake was characterized in this study. New information is provided on the taxonomic and functional diversity of the representative Archaea phyla, Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, as well as those that are representative of Bacteria, Thermotogales and Aquificae. With culture of microbial consortia and with the genetic information collected from the natural environment sampling, metabolic interactions were identified between prokaryotes, which can withstand multiple extreme conditions. The existence of a close relationship between the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur in an active volcano has been proposed, while the relationship in the energy metabolism of thermoacidophilic bacteria and archaea in this multi-extreme environment was biochemically revealed for the first time. These findings contribute towards understanding microbial metabolism under extreme conditions, and provide potential knowledge pertaining to "microbial dark matter", which can be applied to biotechnological processes and evolutionary studies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Electromicrobiology can be used to understand extracellular electron uptake in previously undescribed chemolithotrophs. Enrichment and characterization of the uncultivated electroautotroph “Candidatus Tenderia electrophaga” using electromicrobiology led to the designation of the order Tenderiales. Representative Tenderiales metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) have been identified in a number of environmental surveys, yet a comprehensive characterization of conserved genes for extracellular electron uptake has thus far not been conducted. Using comparative genomics, we identified conserved orthologous genes within the Tenderiales and nearest-neighbor orders important for extracellular electron uptake based on a previously proposed pathway from “Ca. Tenderia electrophaga.” The Tenderiales contained a conserved cluster we designated uetABCDEFGHIJ, which encodes proteins containing features that would enable transport of extracellular electrons to cytoplasmic membrane-bound energy-transducing complexes such as two conserved cytochrome cbb3 oxidases. For example, UetJ is predicted to be an extracellular undecaheme c-type cytochrome that forms a heme wire. We also identified clusters of genes predicted to facilitate assembly and maturation of electron transport proteins, as well as cellular attachment to surfaces. Autotrophy among the Tenderiales is supported by the presence of carbon fixation and stress response pathways that could allow cellular growth by extracellular electron uptake. Key differences between the Tenderiales and other known neutrophilic iron oxidizers were revealed, including very few Cyc2 genes in the Tenderiales. Our results reveal a possible conserved pathway for extracellular electron uptake and suggest that the Tenderiales have an ecological role in coupling metal or mineral redox chemistry and the carbon cycle in marine and brackish sediments. © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.

Amid an extensively managed surface geothermal park, an undisturbed hot spring emerges with source water at 61°C, pH 6.8, and 1 mg/L dissolved sulfide. A small main pool at the source supported orange-green benthic flocs, whereas the outflow channel with gradually less extreme environmental stress supported extensive vivid green microbial mats. Microscopy revealed that cyanobacterial morphotypes were distinct in flocs and mats at several intervals along the environmental gradient, and we describe a spiraling pattern in the oscillatorian cyanobacteria that may reflect response to poly-extreme stress. Estimation of diversity using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed assemblages that were dominated by phototrophic bacteria. The most abundant taxa in flocs at 61°C/1 mg/L sulfide were Roseiflexus sp. and Thermosynechococcus elongatus, whilst the mats at 45.7–55.3°C/0–0.5 mg/L sulfide were dominated by Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium MTP1 and Chloroflexus sp. Occurrence of diverse chemoautotrophs and heterotrophs reflected known thermal ranges for taxa, and of note was the high abundance of thermophilic cellulolytic bacteria that likely reflected the large allochthonous leaf input. A clear shift in ASV-defined putative ecotypes occurred along the environmental stress gradient of the hot spring and overall diversity was inversely correlated to environmental stress. Significant correlations for abiotic variables with observed biotic diversity were identified for temperature, sulfide, and carbonate. A network analysis revealed three putative modules of biotic interactions that also reflected the taxonomic composition at intervals along the environmental gradient. Overall, the data indicated that three distinct microbial communities were supported within a small spatial scale along the poly-extreme environmental gradient. The findings add to the growing inventory of hot spring microbiomes and address an important biogeographic knowledge gap for the region. Copyright © 2023 George, Lim, Tong and Pointing.},

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an essential cornerstone in bioinformatics, which can reveal the potential information in biological sequences, such as function, evolution and structure. MSA is widely used in many bioinformatics scenarios, such as phylogenetic analysis, protein analysis and genomic analysis. However, MSA faces new challenges with the gradual increase in sequence scale and the increasing demand for alignment accuracy. Therefore, developing an efficient and accurate strategy for MSA has become one of the research hotspots in bioinformatics. In this work, we mainly summarize the algorithms for MSA and its applications in bioinformatics. To provide a structured and clear perspective, we systematically introduce MSA’s knowledge, including background, database, metric and benchmark. Besides, we list the most common applications of MSA in the field of bioinformatics, including database searching, phylogenetic analysis, genomic analysis, metagenomic analysis and protein analysis. Furthermore, we categorize and analyze classical and state-of-the-art algorithms, divided into progressive alignment, iterative algorithm, heuristics, machine learning and divide-and-conquer. Moreover, we also discuss the challenges and opportunities of MSA in bioinformatics. Our work provides a comprehensive survey of MSA applications and their relevant algorithms. It could bring valuable insights for researchers to contribute their knowledge to MSA and relevant studies. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The sulfur cycle encompasses a series of complex aerobic and anaerobic transformations of S-containing molecules and plays a fundamental role in cellular and ecosystem-level processes, influencing biological carbon transfers and other biogeochemical cycles. Despite their importance, the microbial communities and metabolic pathways involved in these transformations remain poorly understood, especially for inorganic sulfur compounds of intermediate oxidation states (thiosulfate, tetrathionate, sulfite, polysulfides). Isolated and highly stratified, the extreme geochemical and environmental features of meromictic ice-capped Lake A, in the Canadian High Arctic, provided an ideal model ecosystem to resolve the distribution and metabolism of aquatic sulfur cycling microorganisms along redox and salinity gradients. Results: Applying complementary molecular approaches, we identified sharply contrasting microbial communities and metabolic potentials among the markedly distinct water layers of Lake A, with similarities to diverse fresh, brackish and saline water microbiomes. Sulfur cycling genes were abundant at all depths and covaried with bacterial abundance. Genes for oxidative processes occurred in samples from the oxic freshwater layers, reductive reactions in the anoxic and sulfidic bottom waters and genes for both transformations at the chemocline. Up to 154 different genomic bins with potential for sulfur transformation were recovered, revealing a panoply of taxonomically diverse microorganisms with complex metabolic pathways for biogeochemical sulfur reactions. Genes for the utilization of sulfur cycle intermediates were widespread throughout the water column, co-occurring with sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidation pathways. The genomic bin composition suggested that in addition to chemical oxidation, these intermediate sulfur compounds were likely produced by the predominant sulfur chemo- and photo-oxidisers at the chemocline and by diverse microbial degraders of organic sulfur molecules. Conclusions: The Lake A microbial ecosystem provided an ideal opportunity to identify new features of the biogeochemical sulfur cycle. Our detailed metagenomic analyses across the broad physico-chemical gradients of this permanently stratified lake extend the known diversity of microorganisms involved in sulfur transformations over a wide range of environmental conditions. The results indicate that sulfur cycle intermediates and organic sulfur molecules are major sources of electron donors and acceptors for aquatic and sedimentary microbial communities in association with the classical sulfur cycle.

	abstract = {Halomonas bacteria are ubiquitous in global marine environments, however, their sulfur-oxidizing abilities and survival adaptations in hydrothermal environments are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the sulfur oxidation ability and metabolic mechanisms of Halomonas titanicae SOB56, which was isolated from the sediment of the Tangyin hydrothermal field in the Southern Okinawa Trough. Physiological characterizations showed that it is a heterotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium that can oxidize thiosulfate to tetrathionate, with the Na2S2O3 degradation reaching 94.86%. Two potential thiosulfate dehydrogenase-related genes, tsdA and tsdB, were identified as encoding key catalytic enzymes, and their expression levels in strain SOB56 were significantly upregulated. Nine of fifteen examined Halomonas genomes possess TsdA- and TsdB-homologous proteins, whose amino acid sequences have two typical Cys-X2-Cys-His heme-binding regions. Moreover, the thiosulfate oxidation process in H. titanicae SOB56 might be regulated by quorum sensing, and autoinducer-2 synthesis protein LuxS was identified in its genome. Regarding the mechanisms underlying adaptation to hydrothermal environment, strain SOB56 was capable of forming biofilms and producing EPS. In addition, genes related to complete flagellum assembly system, various signal transduction histidine kinases, heavy metal transporters, anaerobic respiration, and variable osmotic stress regulation were also identified. Our results shed light on the potential functions of heterotrophic Halomonas bacteria in hydrothermal sulfur cycle and revealed possible adaptations for living at deep-sea hydrothermal fields by H. titanicae SOB56.

	abstract = {For the last six decades, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs/P450s), heme thiolate proteins, have been under the spotlight due to their regio-and stereo-selective oxidation activi-ties, which has led to the exploration of their applications in almost all known areas of biology. The availability of many genome sequences allows us to understand the evolution of P450s in different organisms, especially in the Bacteria domain. The phenomenon that “P450s play a key role in organisms’ adaptation vis a vis lifestyle of organisms impacts P450 content in their genome” was proposed based on studies on a handful of individual bacterial groups. To have conclusive evidence, one must analyze P450s and their role in secondary metabolism in species with diverse lifestyles but that belong to the same category. We selected species of the phylum Proteobacteria classes, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon, to address this research gap due to their diverse lifestyle and ancient nature. The study identified that the lifestyle of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, and epsilon-proteobacterial species profoundly affected P450 profiles in their genomes. The study determined that irrespective of the species associated with different proteobacterial classes, pathogenic species or species adapted to a simple lifestyle lost or had few P450s in their genomes. On the contrary, species with saprophytic or complex lifestyles had many P450s and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. The study findings prove that the phenomenon mentioned above is factual, and there is no link between the number and diversity of P450s and the age of the bacteria. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Microbial diversification is driven by geographic and ecological factors, but how the relative importance of these factors varies among species, geographic scales, and habitats remains unclear. Streptomyces, a genus of antibiotic-producing, spore-forming, and widespread bacteria, offers a robust model for identifying the processes underlying population differentiation. We examined the population structure of 37 Streptomyces olivaceus strains isolated from various sources, showing that they diverged into two habitat-associated (free-living and insect-associated) and geographically disparate lineages. More frequent gene flow within than between the lineages confirmed genetic isolation in S. olivaceus. Geographic isolation could not explain the genetic isolation; instead, habitat type was a strong predictor of genetic distance when controlling for geographic distance. The identification of habitat-specific genetic variations, including genes involved in regulation, resource use, and secondary metabolism, suggested a significant role of habitat adaptation in the diversification process. Physiological assays revealed fitness trade-offs under different environmental conditions in the two lineages. Notably, insect-associated isolates could outcompete free-living isolates in a free-iron-deficient environment. Furthermore, substrate (e.g., sialic acid and glycogen) utilization but not thermal traits differentiated the two lineages. Overall, our results argue that adaptive processes drove ecological divergence among closely related streptomycetes, eventually leading to dispersal limitation and gene flow barriers between the lineages. S. olivaceus may best be considered a species complex consisting of two cryptic species. IMPORTANCE Both isolation by distance and isolation by environment occur in bacteria, and different diversification patterns may apply to different species. Streptomyces species, typified by producing useful natural products, are widespread in nature and possess high genetic diversity. However, the ecological processes and evolutionary mechanisms that shape their distribution are not well understood. Here, we show that the population structure of a ubiquitous Streptomyces species complex matches its habitat distribution and can be defined by gene flow discontinuities. Using comparative genomics and physiological assays, we reveal that gains and losses of specific genomic traits play a significant role in the transition between free-living and host-associated lifestyles, driving speciation of the species. These results provide new insights into the evolutionary trajectory of Streptomyces and the notion of species. Copyright © 2022 Wang et al.},

The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the TCSs with the same domains were clustered in the same cluster, indicating similar functions of these TCSs. The biological functions of 25 pairs of TCSs in P. fluorescens PF08 were successfully predicted, mainly participating in the regulation of nutrient metabolism, material transport, cell differentiation,adaptation to adverse environments, cell resistance and virulence. This study may provide some references for further elucidating the functions of TCSs in the environmental adaptation of P. fluorescens PF08 from aquatic products. © 2021, China Food Publishing Company.

	abstract = {Sulfur is not only one of the most abundant elements on the Earth, but it is also essential to all living organisms. As life likely began and evolved in a hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-rich environment, sulfur metabolism represents an early form of energy generation via various reactions in prokaryotes and has driven the sulfur biogeochemical cycle since. It has long been known that H2S is toxic to cells at high concentrations, but now this gaseous molecule, at the physiological level, is recognized as a signaling molecule and a regulator of critical biological processes. Recently, many metabolites of H2S, collectively called reactive sulfur species (RSS), have been gradually appreciated as having similar or divergent regulatory roles compared with H2S in living organisms, especially mammals. In prokaryotes, even in bacteria, investigations into generation and physiology of RSS remain preliminary and an understanding of the relevant biological processes is still in its infancy. Despite this, recent and exciting advances in the fields are many. Here, we discuss abiotic and biotic generation of H2S/RSS, sulfur-transforming enzymes and their functioning mechanisms, and their physiological roles as well as the sensing and regulation of H2S/RSS. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Around 100 Mt of phosphogypsum (PG) have been deposited in large stacks on the salt marshes of the Tinto River estuary in Huelva (SW Spain), covering about 1000 ha. These stacks contain extremely acidic water (pH < 2) with high concentrations of pollutants which can cause emissions into their surroundings, generating important environmental concerns. Despite many chemical, geological or hydrological studies have been conducted to characterize the PG stacks of Huelva, the microbial community inhabiting this extreme environment remains unexplored. Using a 16S/18S-rRNA-high throughput sequencing approach, we have uncovered the main taxonomic groups able to live in the acidic metal-contaminated water, which is in direct contact with the PG, demonstrating for the first time the existence of a huge diversity of microbial species in these extreme conditions. In addition, the physicochemical characteristics of the water sampled have been analyzed. These studies have revealed that the most abundant bacteria found in two different leachate samples of the PG stacks belong to the genera Acidiphilium, Pseudomonas, Leptosprillum, Acidithrix, or Acidithiobacillus, typically found in acid mine drainage (AMD) environments, which in total represent around 50% of the total bacterial community. Biodiversity of eukaryotes in PG water is lower than that of prokaryotes, especially in the water collected from the perimeter channel that surrounds the PG stacks, where the pH reaches a value of 1.5 and the activity concentrations exceed 300 Bq L−1 for 238U or 20 Bq L−1 for 210Po, values which are from four to five orders of magnitude higher than those usually found in unperturbed surface waters. Even so, an unexpected diversity of algae, fungi, and ciliates have been found in the PG stacks of Huelva, where chlorophyte microalgae and basidiomycetes fungi are the most abundant eukaryotes. Additional bioinformatics tools have been used to perform a functional analysis and predict the most common metabolic pathways in the PG microbiota. The obtained data indicate that the extreme conditions of these PG stacks hide an unexpected microbial diversity, which can play an important role in the dynamics of the contaminating compounds of the PG and provide new strains with unique biotechnological applications. © 2022},

	abstract = {The genus Alcanivorax is common in various marine environments, including in hydrothermal fields. They were previously recognized as obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, but their potential for autotrophic carbon fixation and Fe(II)-oxidation remains largely elusive. In this study, an in situ enrichment experiment was performed using a hydrothermal massive sulfide slab deployed 300 m away from the Wocan hydrothermal vent. Furthermore, the biofilms on the surface of the slab were used as an inoculum, with hydrothermal massive sulfide powder from the same vent as an energy source, to enrich the potential iron oxidizer in the laboratory. Three dominant bacterial families, Alcanivoraceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Rhizobiaceae, were enriched in the medium with hydrothermal massive sulfides. Subsequently, strain Alcanivorax sp. MM125-6 was isolated from the enrichment culture. It belongs to the genus Alcanivorax and is closely related to Alcanivorax profundimaris ST75FaO-1T (98.9% sequence similarity) indicated by a phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Autotrophic growth experiments on strain MM125-6 revealed that the cell concentrations were increased from an initial 7.5 × 105 cells/ml to 3.13 × 108 cells/ml after 10 days, and that the δ13CVPDB in the cell biomass was also increased from 234.25‰ on day 2 to gradually 345.66 ‰ on day 10. The gradient tube incubation showed that bands of iron oxides and cells formed approximately 1 and 1.5 cm, respectively, below the air-agarose medium interface. In addition, the SEM-EDS data demonstrated that it can also secrete acidic exopolysaccharides and adhere to the surface of sulfide minerals to oxidize Fe(II) with NaHCO3 as the sole carbon source, which accelerates hydrothermal massive sulfide dissolution. These results support the conclusion that strain MM125-6 is capable of autotrophic carbon fixation and Fe(II) oxidization chemoautotrophically. This study expands our understanding of the metabolic versatility of the Alcanivorax genus as well as their important role(s) in coupling hydrothermal massive sulfide weathering and iron and carbon cycles in hydrothermal fields.

The present study is the first global analysis of the early transcriptional response of exponentially growing G. diazotrophicus to iron, an essential cofactor for many enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways. RNA-seq, targeted gene mutagenesis and computational motif discovery tools were used to define the G. diazotrophicus fur regulon. The data analysis showed that genes encoding functions related to iron homeostasis were significantly upregulated in response to iron limitations. Certain genes involved in secondary metabolism were overexpressed under iron-limited conditions. In contrast, it was observed that the expression of genes involved in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, flagellar biosynthesis and type IV secretion systems were downregulated in an iron-depleted culture medium. Our results support a model that controls transcription in G. diazotrophicus by fur function. The G. diazotrophicus fur protein was able to complement an E. coli fur mutant.

They have received significant interest the last several years, but advancement is still slow due to the lack of a robust genetic toolbox in most organisms. Typically, “domestication” of a new non-model microorganism has been done on an ad hoc basis, and historically, it can take years to develop transformation and basic genetic tools. Here, we review the barriers and solutions to rapid development of genetic transformation tools in new hosts, with a major focus on Restriction-Modification systems, which are a well-known and significant barrier to efficient transformation. We further explore the tools and approaches used for efficient gene deletion, DNA insertion, and heterologous gene expression.

	abstract = {Lithium (Li) is primarily found in mineral resources, brines, and seawater. Extraction of Li from mineral ore deposits is expensive and energy-intensive. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are certainly one of the important alternatives to lessen the dependence on fossil fuel resources. The global demand for LIBs for portable electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and EVs have increased significantly, and the amount of spent LIBs (S-LIBs) is rising logarithmically. S-LIBs contain both hazardous heavy metals and toxic organic chemicals that create a serious threat to human health and the ecosystem. The current position requires the recycling of S-LIBs indispensable for the protection of the environment and the recycling of scarce raw materials from economic aspects. In this manuscript, recent developments and state-of-the-art technologies for LIB recycling were focused on and reviewed comprehensively. Pretreatment methods (such as discharging, dismantling, cathode active material (CAM) removal, binder elimination methods, classification, and separation) for S-LIBs are introduced, and all available and novel technologies that are used in different physical and chemical recovery processes are summarized and compared. The pretreatment process in LIB recycling can both improve the recovery rate of the valuable components and significantly lessen the subsequent energy consumption. Notably, pretreatment, metal extraction, and product preparation stages play vital roles in all LIB recovery processes, based on pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, biometallurgy, direct recycling, and mechanical treatment and water leaching. The main goal of this review is to address the novel S-LIB materials’ current recycling research status and innovations for integrated, eco-friendly, economic, low carbon, and clean energy technologies. In the end, different industrial recycling processes are compared, existing challenges are identified and suggestions and perspectives for future LIBs recycling applications are highlighted. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Past acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems on Mars have promise in their ability to have hosted life for billions of years. One method for analyzing these systems is to study analog environments on Earth. To assess the astrobiological potential of Martian acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems, the crater lake of the active Poás Volcano, Laguna Caliente, was sampled in 2013 and 2017. Laguna Caliente presents an extremely dynamic terrestrial environment with near-ambient to boiling temperatures, pH fluctuations from −0.87 to 1.5, a wide range of chemistries and redox potential, and frequent phreatic-to-phreatomagmatic eruptions. Samples of lake fluid, sulfur clumps, and lake bottom sediment underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic “shotgun” sequencing, which revealed this lake hosts an extremely low biodiversity of microorganisms dominated by Acidiphilium spp. Shotgun metagenomics of the samples suggests this community has numerous genetic adaptations that confer survival, including functional pathways to reduce the effects of toxic metals and numerous metabolic pathways utilizing a variety of simple and complex sugar molecules. The identification of these various metabolic pathways suggests adaptations related to carbon limited environments, fulfillment of high energy requirements, and survival in a hostile volcanic setting. The perseverance of life in Laguna Caliente indicates life on Mars could have thrived in analogous environments, stressing the need for the search for life in relict Martian acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems.

	abstract = {An isolate, designated strain KIGAM418T was isolated from marine mud below 192 m depth in the Hupo Basin, Republic of Korea. Strain KIGAM418T was Gram-stain positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic, and grew at 10‒45 °C, in 0‒2% (w/v) NaCl at pH 4.0‒12.0. The strain tested positive for catalase, oxidase, and motility. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain KIGAM418T was related to the genus Fictibacillus. The strain showed the highest similarity to Fictibacillus rigui WPCB074T (98.0–98.1%) and Fictibacillus solisalsi YC1T (97.2–97.8%). The diagnostic diamino acid of the cell wall was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major fatty acids were characterized as anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0. Strain KIGAM418T possessed diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine as the major polar lipids and menaquinone-7 as the predominant menaquinone. The genome size and G + C content were 4.56 Mb and 43.2 mol%, respectively. According to predicted functional genes of the genome, the category of amino acid transport and metabolism was mainly distributed. Based on the polyphasic taxonomic data, strain KIGAM418T represents a novel species of the genus Fictibacillus, for which the name Fictibacillus marinisediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KIGAM418T (= KCTC 43291 T = JCM 34437 T). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Acidophilic microorganisms like Leptospirillum sp. CF-1 thrive in environments with extremely low pH and high concentrations of dissolved heavy metals that can induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several hypothetical genes and proteins from Leptospirillum sp. CF-1 are known to be up-regulated under oxidative stress conditions. Results: In the present work, the function of hypothetical gene ABH19_09590 from Leptospirillum sp. CF-1 was studied. Heterologous expression of this gene in Escherichia coli led to an increase in the ability to grow under oxidant conditions with 5 mM K2CrO4 or 5 mM H2O2. Similarly, a significant reduction in ROS production in E. coli transformed with a plasmid carrying ABH19_09590 was observed after exposure to these oxidative stress elicitors for 30 min, compared to a strain complemented with the empty vector. A co-transcriptional study using RT-PCR showed that ABH19_09590 is contained in an operon, here named the “och” operon, that also contains ABH19_09585, ABH19_09595 and ABH19_09600 genes. The expression of the och operon was significantly up-regulated in Leptospirillum sp. CF-1 exposed to 5 mM K2CrO4 for 15 and 30 min. Genes of this operon potentially encode a NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, a CXXC motif-containing protein likely involved in thiol/disulfide exchange, a hypothetical protein, and a di-hydroxy-acid dehydratase. A comparative genomic analysis revealed that the och operon is a characteristic genetic determinant of the Leptospirillum genus that is not present in other acidophiles. Conclusions: Altogether, these results suggest that the och operon plays a protective role against chromate and hydrogen peroxide and is an important mechanism required to face polyextremophilic conditions in acid environments. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Enzymes are outstanding (bio)catalysts, not solely on account of their ability to increase reaction rates by up to several orders of magnitude but also for the high degree of substrate specificity, regiospecificity and stereospecificity. The use and development of enzymes as robust biocatalysts is one of the main challenges in biotechnology. However, despite the high specificities and turnover of enzymes, there are also drawbacks. At the industrial level, these drawbacks are typically overcome by resorting to immobilized enzymes to enhance stability. Immobilization of biocatalysts allows their reuse, increases stability, facilitates process control, eases product recovery, and enhances product yield and quality. This is especially important for expensive enzymes, for those obtained in low fermentation yield and with relatively low activity. This review provides an integrated perspective on (multi)enzyme immobilization that abridges a critical evaluation of immobilization methods and carriers, biocatalyst metrics, impact of key carrier features on biocatalyst performance, trends towards miniaturization and detailed illustrative examples that are representative of biocatalytic applications promoting sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Abstract: Metal(loid) selection contributes to selection pressure on antibiotic resistance, but to our knowledge, evidence of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) induced by metal(loid)s in mine soil ecosystems is rare. In the current study, using a high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based metagenomic approach, 819 ARG subtypes were identified in a mine soil ecosystem, indicating that these environmental habitats are important reservoirs of ARGs. The results showed that metal(loid)-induced coselection has an important role in the distribution of soil ARGs. Furthermore, metal(loid) selection-induced ARGs were mainly associated with resistance-nodulation-division (RND) antibiotic efflux, which is distinct from what is observed in agricultural soil ecosystems. By using independent genome binning, metal(loid)s were shown impose coselection pressure on multiple ARGs residing on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which promotes the dissemination of the antibiotic resistome. Interestingly, the current results showed that the density of several MGEs conferring ARGs was considerably higher in organisms most closely related to the priority pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Together, the results of this study indicate that mine soil ecosystems are important reservoirs of ARGs and that metal(loid)-induced coselection plays critical roles in the dissemination of ARGs in this type of soil habitat. Key points: • Mining soil ecosystem is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). • ARGs distribute via bacterial resistance-nodulation-division efflux systems. • Metal(loid)s coselected ARGs residing on mobile genetic elements in P. aeruginosa and E. coli.

	abstract = {Bacteria in the order ‘Candidatus Brocadiales’ within the phylum Planctomycetes (Planctomycetota) have the remarkable ability to perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Two families of anammox bacteria with different biogeographical distributions have been reported, marine Ca. Scalinduaceae and freshwater Ca. Brocadiaceae. Here we report evidence of three new species within a novel genus and family of anammox bacteria, which were discovered in biofilms of a subsea road tunnel under a fjord in Norway. In this particular ecosystem, the nitrogen cycle is likely fuelled by ammonia from organic matter degradation in the fjord sediments and the rock mass above the tunnel, resulting in the growth of biofilms where anammox bacteria can thrive under oxygen limitation. We resolved several metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of anammox bacteria, including three Ca. Brocadiales MAGs that could not be classified at the family level. MAGs of this novel family had all the diagnostic genes for a full anaerobic ammonium oxidation pathway in which nitrite was probably reduced by a NirK-like reductase. A survey of published molecular data indicated that this new family of anammox bacteria occurs in many marine sediments, where its members presumably would contribute to nitrogen loss. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Microbes are present in almost every environment on Earth, even in those with extreme environmental conditions such as Antarctica, where rocks may represent the main refuge for life. Lithobiontic communities are composed of microorganisms capable of colonizing rocks and, as it is a not so well studied bacterial community, they may represent a very interesting source of diversity and functional traits with potential for biotechnological applications. In this work we analyzed the ability of Antarctic lithobiontic bacterium to synthesize cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) and their potential application in solar cells. Results: A basaltic andesite rock sample was collected from Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, and processed in order to isolate lithobiontic bacterial strains. Out of the 11 selected isolates, strain UYP1, identified as Pedobacter, was chosen for further characterization and analysis due to its high cadmium tolerance. A protocol for the biosynthesis of CdS QDs was developed and optimized for this strain. After 20 and 80 min of synthesis, yellow-green and orange-red fluorescent emissions were observed under UV light, respectively. QDs were characterized through spectroscopic techniques, dynamic light scattering analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Nanostructures of 3.07 nm, composed of 51.1% cadmium and 48.9% sulfide were obtained and further used as photosensitizer material in solar cells. These solar cells were able to conduct electrons and displayed an open circuit voltage of 162 mV, a short circuit current density of 0.0110 mA cm−2, and had an efficiency of conversion up to 0.0016%, which is comparable with data previously reported for solar cells sensitized with biologically produced quantum dots. Conclusions: We report a cheap, rapid and eco-friendly protocol for the production of CdS QDs by an Antarctic lithobiontic bacterium, Pedobacter, a genus that was not previously reported as a quantum dot producer. The application of the biosynthesized QDs as sensitizer material in solar cells was validated. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The Himalayas are one of the most mystical, yet least studied terrains of the world. One of Earth’s greatest multifaceted and diverse montane ecosystems is also one of the thirty-four global biodiversity hotspots of the world. These are supposed to have been uplifted about 60–70 million years ago and support, distinct environments, physiography, a variety of orogeny, and great biological diversity (plants, animals, and microbes). Microbes are the pioneer colonizer of the Himalayas that are involved in various bio-geological cycles and play various significant roles. The applications of Himalayan microbiomes inhabiting in lesser to greater Himalayas have been recognized. The researchers explored the applications of indigenous microbiomes in both agricultural and environmental sectors. In agriculture, microbiomes from Himalayan regions have been suggested as better biofertilizers and biopesticides for the crops growing at low temperature and mountainous areas as they help in the alleviation of cold stress and other biotic stresses. Along with alleviation of low temperature, Himalayan microbes also have the capability to enhance plant growth by availing the soluble form of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron. These microbes have been recognized for producing plant growth regulators (abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, and gibberellins). These microbes have been reported for bioremediating the diverse pollutants (pesticides, heavy metals, and xenobiotics) for environmental sustainability. In the current perspectives, present review provides a detailed discussion on the ecology, biodiversity, and adaptive features of the native Himalayan microbiomes in view to achieve agro-environmental sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The organisms surviving in extreme environments deploy system support including self-protection, and energy distribution to counter extreme environmental stresses. The biological adaptations provide clues about the metabolic networks and regulatory circuits involved in their success in survival to extreme environments of these organisms. Besides this, genes and proteins of these extremophiles have gained worldwide attention of researchers, due to their immense biotechnological importance including source of novel enzymes and biomolecules for applications in industrial processes. Therefore, obtaining an insight into genomic aspects is of vital importance for basic and applied research. Genome wide studies showed that the microbes living in extreme habitats reorganize their genome using insertion, expansion or reduction of genome size, gene reshuffling through displacements and genes reorganization, G+C skewness in the genome, horizontal transfer of genes, change in polyploidy level, and preference for codon in genes that assists during adaptations to environmental extremes. For example, the comparative genomics studies revealed a significant loss of genes in acidophiles than in alkaliphiles and smaller genome size of thermophiles in comparison to psychrophiles. The genomic adaptations in halotolerance include polyploidy, battery of genes for the biosynthesis of organic osmolytes, mechanism of inorganic osmolytes acquisition and role of inorganic osmolytes and transporter system. Furthermore, it is evident that local niche specific adaptations also play a key role during adaptations to extreme environments. All these adaptations maintain extremophiles as operational units and provide them a competitive advantage over their counterparts. The review article describes the genomic multifaceted adaptation at genomic and physiological levels of extremophiles that assists in reshaping the prokaryotic extremophiles during adaptations to extreme environments to obtain a competitive edge. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

More precisely, given a set X of syntenies in a set Σ of genomes, a tree T for X and a tree S for Σ, the problem is to find a most parsimonious history for X with respect to a given evolutionary model. We extend a previous model involving segmental duplications and losses, to also include segmental horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) and gene gains. We present a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem. We apply it to CRISPR-associated (Cas) gene syntenies. These genes are part of CRISPR-Cas systems, one of its members (CRISPR-Cas9) well-known as currently the most reliable and accurate molecular scissor technology for genome editing. The inferred evolutionary scenario is a plausible explanation of the diversification of this system into its different types.

	abstract = {Verrucomicrobia are a group of microorganisms that have been proposed to be deeply rooted in the Tree of Life. Some are methanotrophs that oxidize the potent greenhouse gas methane and are thus important in decreasing atmospheric concentrations of the gas, potentially ameliorating climate change. They are widespread in various environments including soil and fresh or marine waters. Recently, a clade of extremely acidophilic Verrucomicrobia, flourishing at pH < 3, were described from high-temperature geothermal ecosystems. This novel group could be of interest for studies about the emergence of life on Earth and to astrobiologists as homologs for possible extraterrestrial life. In this paper, we describe predicted mechanisms for survival of this clade at low pH and suggest its possible evolutionary trajectory from an inferred neutrophilic ancestor. Extreme acidophiles are defined as organisms that thrive in extremely low pH environments (≤ pH 3). Many are polyextremophiles facing high temperatures and high salt as well as low pH. They are important to study for both providing fundamental insights into biological mechanisms of survival and evolution in such extreme environments and for understanding their roles in biotechnological applications such as industrial mineral recovery (bioleaching) and mitigation of acid mine drainage. They are also, potentially, a rich source of novel genes and pathways for the genetic engineering of microbial strains. Acidophiles of the Verrucomicrobia phylum are unique as they are the only known aerobic methanotrophs that can grow optimally under acidic (pH 2–3) and moderately thermophilic conditions (50–60°C). Three moderately thermophilic genera, namely Methylacidiphilum, Methylacidimicrobium, and Ca. Methylacidithermus, have been described in geothermal environments. Most of the investigations of these organisms have focused on their methane oxidizing capabilities (methanotrophy) and use of lanthanides as a protein cofactor, with no extensive study that sheds light on the mechanisms that they use to flourish at extremely low pH. In this paper, we extend the phylogenetic description of this group of acidophiles using whole genome information and we identify several mechanisms, potentially involved in acid resistance, including “first line of defense” mechanisms that impede the entry of protons into the cell. These include the presence of membrane-associated hopanoids, multiple copies of the outer membrane protein (Slp), and inner membrane potassium channels (kup, kdp) that generate a reversed membrane potential repelling the intrusion of protons. Acidophilic Verrucomicrobia also display a wide array of proteins potentially involved in the “second line of defense” where protons that evaded the first line of defense and entered the cell are expelled or neutralized, such as the glutamate decarboxylation (gadAB) and phosphate-uptake systems. An exclusive N-type ATPase F0-F1 was identified only in acidophiles of Verrucomicrobia and is predicted to be a specific adaptation in these organisms. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that many predicted mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved and most likely entered the acidophilic lineage of Verrucomicrobia by vertical descent from a common ancestor. However, it is likely that some defense mechanisms such as gadA and kup entered the acidophilic Verrucomicrobia lineage by horizontal gene transfer. Copyright © 2022 Neira, Vergara and Holmes.},

	abstract = {Extreme acidophiles thrive in environments rich in protons (pH values <3) and often high levels of dissolved heavy metals. They are distributed across the three domains of the Tree of Life including members of the Proteobacteria. The Acidithiobacillia class is formed by the neutrophilic genus Thermithiobacillus along with the extremely acidophilic genera Fervidacidithiobacillus, Igneacidithiobacillus, Ambacidithiobacillus, and Acidithiobacillus. Phylogenomic reconstruction revealed a division in the Acidithiobacillia class correlating with the different pH optima that suggested that the acidophilic genera evolved from an ancestral neutrophile within the Acidithiobacillia. Genes and mechanisms denominated as “first line of defense” were key to explaining the Acidithiobacillia acidophilic lifestyle including preventing proton influx that allows the cell to maintain a near-neutral cytoplasmic pH and differ from the neutrophilic Acidithiobacillia ancestors that lacked these systems. Additional differences between the neutrophilic and acidophilic Acidithiobacillia included the higher number of gene copies in the acidophilic genera coding for “second line of defense” systems that neutralize and/or expel protons from cell. Gain of genes such as hopanoid biosynthesis involved in membrane stabilization at low pH and the functional redundancy for generating an internal positive membrane potential revealed the transition from neutrophilic properties to a new acidophilic lifestyle by shaping the Acidithiobacillaceae genomic structure. The presence of a pool of accessory genes with functional redundancy provides the opportunity to “hedge bet” in rapidly changing acidic environments. Although a core of mechanisms for acid resistance was inherited vertically from an inferred neutrophilic ancestor, the majority of mechanisms, especially those potentially involved in resistance to extremely low pH, were obtained from other extreme acidophiles by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events.

	abstract = {Pyrite bio-oxidation by chemolithotrophic acidophile bacteria has been applied in the mining industry to bioleach metals or to remove pyritic sulfur from coal. In this process, it is desirable to use autochthonous and already adapted bacteria isolated directly from the mining sites where biomining will be applied. Bacteria present in the remnant solution from a mining company were identified through cloning techniques. For that purpose, we extracted total RNA and performed reverse transcription using a novel pair of primers designed from a small region of the 16S gene (V1–V3) that contains the greatest intraspecies diversity. After cloning, a high proportion of individuals of the strains ATCC-23270 (NR_074193.1 and NR_041888.1) and DQ321746.1 of the well-known species Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were found, as well as two new wild strains of A. ferrooxidans. This result showed that the acidic remnant solution comprises a metapopulation. We assayed these strains to produce bioferric flocculant to enhance the subsequent pyrite bio-oxidation, applying two-stage chemical–bacterial oxidation. It was shown that the strains were already adapted to a high concentration of endogenous Fe2+ (up to 20 g·L−1), increasing the volumetric productivity of the bioferric flocculant. Thus, no preadaptation of the community was required. We detected Au and Ag particles originally occluded in the old pyritic flotation tailings assayed, but the extraction of Au and Ag by cyanidation resulted in ca. 30.5% Au and 57.9% Ag. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bacterial metal metabolism and resistance genes are important indicators for microbial ecology, biogeochemistry, and biotechnology. Their investigation enables understanding how bacteria influence the geochemical cycles of elements and how bacteria can be employed in the bioremediation of polluted areas. For environmental screening, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has been used as the method of choice for the detection of metal metabolism and resistance genes, and subsequently, many different PCR primer pairs have been developed for such screening. The aim of this study was the development of a database of PCR primers suitable for the screening of metal metabolism and resistance genes in environmental samples. We conducted an in silico benchmark of 291 previously published PCR primer pairs designed to amplify genes involved in bacterial metabolism and resistance to arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, gold, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc. Our analysis showed that only 16 PCR primer pairs can be considered well designed and suitable for reliable screening in an environmental setup. Furthermore, 55 primer pairs delivered ambiguous results, while the remaining 220 pairs showed no in silico PCR product within their expected product size range. Based on the obtained results, we developed a ranked database (LCPDb-MET; http://lcpdb.ddlemb.com/met/) of primers suitable for the screening of bacterial metal metabolism and resistance genes in various environmental settings. Moreover, since in the course of the study we recognized a serious problem with the classification of metal metabolism and resistance reference sequences, we developed also the METGeneDb database (http://lcpdb.ddlemb.com/downloads). This database covers 106 genes with 7,624 unique sequences divided into 137 potential gene subclusters and it can be used as the reference database in the genomic and metagenomic studies. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Microbes can produce valuable natural products widely applied in medicine, food and other important fields. Nevertheless, it is usually challenging to achieve ideal industrial yields due to low production rate and poor toxicity tolerance. Evolution is a constant mutation and adaptation process used to improve strain performance. Generally speaking, the synthesis of natural products in microbes is often intricate, involving multiple enzymes or multiple pathways. Individual evolution of a certain enzyme often fails to achieve the desired results, and may lead to new rate-limiting nodes that affect the growth of microbes. Therefore, it is inevitable to evolve the biosynthetic pathways or the whole genome. Here, we reviewed the pathway-level evolution including multi-enzyme evolution, regulatory elements engineering, and computer-aided engineering, as well as the genome-level evolution based on several tools, such as genome shuffling and CRISPR/Cas systems. Finally, we also discussed the major challenges faced by in vivo evolution strategies and proposed some potential solutions. © 2022 The Authors},

Persistence and bioaccumulation of such toxins like heavy metals, pesticides/insecticides, aromatic hydrocarbons, radionuclides, oil, petroleum mixtures, etc. induce structural, physiological, neurological, and reproductive disorders/deformities in biotic forms including humans. Among various means of remediation, that is, physical, chemical, and biological, the latter is more valued. Bioremediation involves the usage of living forms like microbes, bacteria, fungi, and plants for detoxification or mineralization of noxious pollutants. Bioaugmentation (addition of microbes) and biostimulation (addition of nutrients to stimulate indigenous microbes) are two majorly employed microbial-assisted remediation methods. However, factors such as vulnerable and dynamic environment, toxicity, bioavailability, monitoring, and survival of microbe degraders are some of the challenges that impede the degradation process. Cell immobilization, acclimatization, genetic modifications, and rhizoremediation are strategies used to aid in microbial sustainability in the field conditions. Bioventing, biosparging, the use of surfactants and nanoparticles hasten the microbial degradation while the use of biomarkers and stable isotope probing aid in assessing the remediation process. The higher costs involved, amicability of supporting matrix both to microbial species and environment, changes in the indigenous community dynamics, volatilization of contaminants into atmosphere, etc. still make these adaptive techniques challenging for implementation of microbe-assisted remediation in the field. Use of advanced technologies like “omics” (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) techniques and synthetic and system biology approaches (mining genes from databases and genome editing) have opened the way for better understood, alternative, and more effective microbe-assisted remediation. In this chapter, we discuss the conventional and emerging strategies of microbe-assisted remediation with a focus on the issues and challenges involved. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Insertion sequences (ISs) are mobile repeat sequences and most of them can copy themselves to new host genome locations, leading to genome plasticity and gene regulation in prokaryotes. In this study, we present functional and evolutionary relationships between IS and neighboring genes in a large-scale comparative genomic analysis. Results: IS families were located in all prokaryotic phyla, with preferential occurrence of IS3, IS4, IS481, and IS5 families in Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes as well as in eukaryote host-associated organisms and autotrophic opportunistic pathogens. We defined the concept of the IS-Gene couple (IG), which allowed to highlight the functional and regulatory impacts of an IS on the closest gene. Genes involved in transcriptional regulation and transport activities were found overrepresented in IG. In particular, major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters, ATP-binding proteins and transposases raised as favorite neighboring gene functions of IS hotspots. Then, evolutionary conserved IS-Gene sets across taxonomic lineages enabled the classification of IS-gene couples into phylum, class-to-genus, and species syntenic IS-Gene couples. The IS5, IS21, IS4, IS607, IS91, ISL3 and IS200 families displayed two to four times more ISs in the phylum and/or class-to-genus syntenic IGs compared to other IS families. This indicates that those families were probably inserted earlier than others and then subjected to horizontal transfer, transposition and deletion events over time. In phylum syntenic IG category, Betaproteobacteria, Crenarchaeota, Calditrichae, Planctomycetes, Acidithiobacillia and Cyanobacteria phyla act as IS reservoirs for other phyla, and neighboring gene functions are mostly related to transcriptional regulators. Comparison of IS occurrences with predicted regulatory motifs led to ~ 26.5% of motif-containing ISs with 2 motifs per IS in average. These results, concomitantly with short IS-Gene distances, suggest that those ISs would interfere with the expression of neighboring genes and thus form strong candidates for an adaptive pairing. Conclusions: All together, our large-scale study provide new insights into the IS genetic context and strongly suggest their regulatory roles. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Saltmarshes are hotspots of organosulfur compound cycling due to production of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by benthic microorganisms, macroalgae, and saltmarsh vegetation. Degradation of DMSP is a source of dimethylsulfide (DMS), an important precursor for formation of secondary organic aerosol. Microorganisms degrading DMS play a role in controlling the amount of DMS available for emission into the atmosphere. Previous work has implicated sediment microbial populations as a major sink for DMS. Here, we show that Sporobolus anglicus (previously known as Spartina anglica), a widely distributed saltmarsh plant, is colonized by DMS-degrading microorganisms. Methods: Dimethylsulfide degradation potential was assessed by gas chromatography and 13C-DMS stable isotope probing, microbial community diversity and functional genetic potential in phyllosphere and rhizosphere samples was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, cloning and sequencing of methanethiol oxidase genes, and by metagenomic analysis of phyllosphere microbial communities. Results: The DMS degradation potential of microbial communities recovered from phyllosphere and rhizosphere samples was similar. Active DMS-degraders were identified by 13C-DMS stable isotope probing and included populations related to Methylophaga and other Piscirickettsiaceae in rhizosphere samples. DMS-degraders in the phyllosphere included Xanthomonadaceae and Halothiobacillaceae. The diversity in sediment samples of the methanethiol oxidase (mtoX) gene, a marker for metabolism of methanethiol during DMS and DMSP degradation, was similar to previously detected saltmarsh mtoX, including those of Methylophaga and Methylococcaeae. Phyllosphere mtoX genes were distinct from sediment mtoX and did not include close relatives of cultivated bacteria. Microbial diversity in the phyllosphere of S. anglicus was distinct compared to those of model plants such as rice, soybean, clover and Arabidopsis and showed a dominance of Gammaproteobacteria rather than Alphaproteobacteria. Conclusion: The potential for microbial DMS degradation in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of Sporobolus anglicus suggest that DMS cycling in saltmarshes is more complex than previously recognised and calls for a more detailed assessment of how aboveground activities affect fluxes of DMS.

	abstract = {Xanthomonas citri pv. punicae (Xcp) is the causative agent of bacterial blight disease in pomegranate and severely affects its production. The current control strategies for this disease provide inadequate protection. Identifying novel bactericide target proteins in pathogenic bacteria and formulating selective chemicals against those proteins is an effective approach to containing the disease. In this study, we used the genome subtraction approach and identified 595 Xcp proteins that are non-homologous to the pomegranate proteome, of which 69 are found to be essential proteins. These 69 proteins are considered possible drug target proteins in Xcp. Further, these proteins were subjected to subcellular localization, KEGG pathway, and virulent prediction analysis. Our systematic bioinformatics analysis deciphered 33 virulent proteins, of which two are iron complex outer membrane receptors, and the third is a T4SS PilQ protein localized in the outer membrane. These outer membrane-localized proteins are potential candidate targets for antibacterial agents, and the two iron complex outer membrane receptor proteins show homology with the Drug bank listed drug target sequences. From this study, we inferred that PilQ could be considered a novel antimicrobial target of Xcp, and therefore we deciphered the PilQ protein–protein interacting partners and phylogenetic relatedness. We have also predicted the physiochemical properties, secondary, and tertiary structure of PilQ protein which will be helpful in the design of antimicrobials. The identification of Xcp specific targets is the first step towards the development of a chemical control agent that is more selective with minimum environmental impact. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The superfamily includes biochemically diverse oxygen reductases and nitric oxide reductases that are pivotal in the pathways of aerobic respiration and denitrification. The adaptation of HCOs to use quinol as the electron donor instead of cytochrome c has significant implication for the respiratory flexibility and energetic efficiency of the respiratory chains that include them. In this work, we explore the adaptation of this scaffold to two different electron donors, cytochromes c and quinols, with extensive sequence analysis of these enzymes from publicly available datasets. Our work shows that quinol oxidation evolved independently within the HCO superfamily at least seven times. Enzymes from only two of these independently evolved clades have been biochemically well-characterized. Combining structural modeling with sequence analysis, we identify putative quinol binding sites in each of the novel quinol oxidases. Our analysis of experimental and modeling data suggests that the quinol binding site appears to have evolved at the same structural position within the scaffold more than once. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Acid-tolerant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) can open the door to new applications, such as partial nitritation at low pH. However, they can also be problematic because chemical nitrite oxidation occurs at low pH, leading to the release of harmful nitrogen oxide gases. In this publication, the role of acid-tolerant AOB in urine treatment was explored. On the one hand, the technical feasibility of ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions for source-separated urine with total nitrogen concentrations up to 3.5 g-N L−1 was investigated. On the other hand, the abundance and growth of acid-tolerant AOB at more neutral pH was explored. Under acidic conditions (pH of 5), ammonia oxidation rates of 500 mg-N L−1 d−1 and 10 g-N g-VSS-1 d-1 were observed, despite high concentrations of 15 mg-N L−1 of the AOB-inhibiting compound nitrous acid and low concentration of 0.04 mg-N L−1 of the substrate ammonia. However, ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions was very sensitive to process disturbances. Even short periods of less than 12 h without oxygen or without influent resulted in a complete cessation of ammonia oxidation with a recovery time of up to two months, which is a problem for low maintenance applications such as decentralized treatment. Furthermore, undesirable nitrogen losses of about 10% were observed. Under acidic conditions, a novel AOB strain was enriched with a relative abundance of up to 80%, for which the name “Candidatus (Ca.) Nitrosacidococcus urinae” is proposed. While Nitrosacidococcus members were present only to a small extent (0.004%) in urine nitrification reactors operated at pH values between 5.8 and 7, acid-tolerant AOB were always enriched during long periods without influent, resulting in an uncontrolled drop in pH to as low as 2.5. Long-term experiments at different pH values showed that the activity of “Ca. Nitrosacidococcus urinae” decreased strongly at a pH of 7, where they were also outcompeted by the acid-sensitive AOB Nitrosomonas halophila. The experiment results showed that the decreased activity of “Ca. Nitrosacidococcus urinae” correlated with the limited availability of dissolved iron at neutral pH. © 2022},

	abstract = {Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is important for converting bioavailable nitrogen into dinitrogen gas, particularly in carbon-poor environments. However, the diversity and prevalence of anammox bacteria in the terrestrial subsurface—a typically oligotrophic environment—are little understood. To determine the distribution and activity of anammox bacteria across a range of aquifer lithologies and physicochemistries, we analyzed 16S rRNA genes and quantified hydrazine synthase genes and transcripts sampled from 59 groundwater wells and metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from an oxic-to-dysoxic subset. Data indicate that anammox and anammox-associated bacteria (class “Candidatus Brocadiae”) are prevalent in the aquifers studied, and that anammox community composition is strongly differentiated by dissolved oxygen (DO), but not ammonia/ nitrite. While “Candidatus Brocadiae” diversity decreased with increasing DO, “Candidatus Brocadiae” 16S rRNA genes and hydrazine synthase (hzsB) genes and transcripts were detected across a wide range of bulk groundwater DO concentrations (0 to 10 mg/L). Anammox genes and transcripts correlated significantly with those involved in aerobic ammonia oxidation (amoA), potentially representing a major source of nitrite for anammox. Eight “Candidatus Brocadiae” genomes (63 to 95% complete), representing 2 uncharacterized families and 6 novel species, were reconstructed. Six genomes have genes characteristic of anammox, all for chemolithoautotrophy. Anammox and aerotolerance genes of up to four “Candidatus Brocadiae” genomes were transcriptionally active under oxic and dysoxic conditions, although activity was highest in dysoxic groundwater. The coexpression of nrfAH nitrite reductase genes by “Candidatus Brocadiae” suggests active regeneration of ammonia for anammox. Our findings indicate that anammox bacteria contribute to loss of fixed N across diverse anoxic-to-oxic aquifer conditions, which is likely supported by nitrite from aerobic ammonia oxidation. © 2022 Mosley et al.

	abstract = {Rhodanobacter species dominate in the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) subsurface environments contaminated with acids, nitrate, metal radionuclides, and other heavy metals. To uncover the genomic features underlying adaptations to these mixed-waste environments and to guide genetic tool development, we sequenced the whole genomes of eight Rhodanobacter strains isolated from the ORR site. The genome sizes ranged from 3.9 to 4.2 Mb harboring 3,695 to 4,035 protein-coding genes and GC contents approximately 67%. Seven strains were classified as R. denitrificans and one strain, FW510-R12, as R. thiooxydans based on full length 16S rRNA sequences. According to gene annotation, the top two Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COGs) with high pan-genome expansion rates (Pan/Core gene ratio) were "replication, recombination and repair"and "defense mechanisms."The denitrifying genes had high DNA homologies except the predicted protein structure variances in NosZ. In contrast, heavy metal resistance genes were diverse with between 7 to 34% of them were located in genomic islands, and these results suggested origins from horizontal gene transfer. Analysis of the methylation patterns in four strains revealed the unique 5mC methylation motifs. Most orthologs (78%) had ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) less than one when compared to the type strain 2APBS1, suggesting the prevalence of negative selection. Overall, the results provide evidence for the important roles of horizontal gene transfer and negative selection in genomic adaptation at the contaminated field site. The complex restriction-modification system genes and the unique methylation motifs in Rhodanobacter strains suggest the potential recalcitrance to genetic manipulation.  © 2022 Peng et al.},

	abstract = {Extremophilic bacteria have numerous uncovered biotechnological potentials. Acidophilic bacteria are important iron oxidizers that are valuable in bioleaching and in studying extreme environments on earth and in space. Despite their obvious potential, little is known about the genetic traits that underpin their metabolic functions, which are equally poorly understood from a mechanistic perspective. Novel bioinformatics and computational biology pipelines can be used to analyze whole genomes to obtain insights into the phenotypic potential of organisms as well as develop a mathematical model representation of metabolism. Whole-genome sequence analysis and a genome-scale metabolic network model was curated for an iron-oxidizing bacterium initially isolated from an acid mine drainage in Turkey, previously identified as Alicyclobacillus tolerans. The genome contained a high proportion of genes for energy generation from carbohydrates, amino acids synthesis and conversion, nucleic acid metabolism and repair which contribute to robust adaption to their extreme environments. Several candidate genes for pyrite metabolism, iron uptake, regulation and storage, as well as genes for resistance to important heavy metals were annotated. A curated genome-scale metabolic network analysis accurately predicted facultative anaerobic growth, heterotrophic characteristics, and growth on a wide variety of carbon sources. This is the first in-depth in silico analysis of A. tolerans to the best of our knowledge which is expected to lay the groundwork for future research and drive innovations in environmental microbiology and biotechnological applications. The genomic data and mechanistic framework will have applications in biomining, synthetic geomicrobiology on earth, as well as for space exploration and settlement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The dominant genera are Geobacter, Nitrobacter, Burkholderia, Candidatus, Bradyrhizobium and Streptomyces. Twenty-one functional categories were present, with fourteen of the functions being dominant in all samples. The dominant functions include carbohydrates, fatty acids, lipids and isoprenoids, amino acids and derivatives, sulfur metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to test samples’ diversity differences. There was a significant difference in the alpha diversity. ANOSIM was used to analyze the similarities of the samples and there were significant differences between the samples. Phosphorus had the highest contribution of 64.3% and was more prominent among the soil properties that influence the functional diversity of the samples.

	abstract = {Diverse yet-uncultivated bacteria and archaea, i.e., microbial dark matter, are present in terrestrial hot spring environments. Numerous metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of these uncultivated prokaryotes by short-read metagenomics have been reported so far, suggesting their metabolic potential. However, more reliable MAGs, i.e., circularized complete MAGs (cMAGs), have been rarely reported from hot spring environments. Here, we report 61 high-quality (HQ)-MAGs, including 14 cMAGs, of diverse uncultivated bacteria and archaea retrieved from hot spring sediment (52°C, pH 7.2) by highly accurate long-read sequencing using PacBio Sequel II. The HQ MAGs were affiliated with one archaeal and 13 bacterial phyla. Notably, nine of the 14 cMAGs were the first reported cMAGs for the family- to class-level clades that these cMAGs belonged to. The genome information suggests that the bacteria represented by MAGs play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, iron, and sulfur at this site. In particular, the genome analysis of six HQ MAGs including two cMAGs of Armatimonadota, of which members are frequently abundant in hot spring environments, predicts that they are aerobic, moderate thermophilic chemoorganoheterotrophs, and potentially oxidize and/or reduce iron. This prediction is consistent with the environmental conditions where they were detected. Our results expand the knowledge regarding the ecological potential of uncultivated bacteria in moderately-high-temperature environments. Copyright © 2022 Kato, Masuda, Shibata, Shirasu and Ohkuma.},

	abstract = {Copper is a trace element that has essential functions in many cellular enzymes; however, excessive copper levels can be toxic. Bacteria have evolved several copper resistance strategies, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Elucidating the mechanisms of copper resistance in bacteria is important for developing microbe-based techniques for mitigation of heavy metal pollution. In this study, a highly copper-resistant (resistant to copper concentrations up to 3.2 mmol∙L−1) bacterial strain RCu6 was isolated. The genomic characteristics of RCu6 were studied using whole-genome sequencing, and copper resistance mechanisms were analyzed using transcriptome analysis. Whole-genome sequencing of strain RCu6 indicated that it belonged to Lysobacter soli. Compared to other strains in the same genus, this strain has a unique DNA fragment encompassing cop, cus, czc, and other homologous copper resistance genes. Transcriptome analysis showed that 315 (239 up-regulated and 76 down-regulated) and 839 (449 up-regulated and 390 down-regulated) genes were differentially expressed under 0.8 mmol∙L−1 and 1.6 mmol∙L−1 copper concentrations, respectively. The differential gene expression was mainly associated with copper homeostasis, histidine metabolism, sulfur metabolism, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly metabolism, indicating that these processes may play important roles in copper resistance of RCu6. The results of the transcriptome analysis were further verified using qPCR. The expression levels of 12 randomly selected genes associated with copper resistance showed significant correlations between qPCR and RNA-Seq data (R2=0.84 for GAPDH gene and R2=0.98 for 16S rRNA gene as internal reference genes). Therefore, the genomic and transcriptome results suggest that copper resistance in the strain Lysobacter soli RCu6 is an intracellular multi-system collaborative process. This study provides new information for understanding the complex regulatory network of copper homeostasis in prokaryotes. It also provides bacterial resources and a theoretical basis for the remediation of heavy metals in farmland soil. © 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The literature has reported the isolation of arsenate-dependent growing microorganisms which lack a canonical homolog for respiratory arsenate reductase, ArrAB. We recently isolated an arsenate-dependent growing bacterium from volcanic arsenic-bearing environments in Northern Chile, Fusibacter sp. strain 3D3 (Fas) and studied the arsenic metabolism in this Gram-positive isolate. Features of Fas deduced from genome analysis and comparative analysis with other arsenate-reducing microorganisms revealed the lack of ArrAB coding genes and the occurrence of two arsC genes encoding for putative cytoplasmic arsenate reductases named ArsC-1 and ArsC-2. Interestingly, ArsC-1 and ArsC-2 belong to the thioredoxin-coupled family (because of the redox-active disulfide protein used as reductant), but they conferred differential arsenate resistance to the E. coli WC3110 ΔarsC strain. PCR experiments confirmed the absence of arrAB genes and results obtained using uncouplers revealed that Fas growth is linked to the proton gradient. In addition, Fas harbors ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (Rnf) and electron transfer flavoprotein (etf) coding genes. These are key molecular markers of a recently discovered flavin-based electron bifurcation mechanism involved in energy conservation, mainly in anaerobic metabolisms regulated by the cellular redox state and mostly associated with cytoplasmic enzyme complexes. At least three electron-bifurcating flavoenzyme complexes were evidenced in Fas, some of them shared in conserved genomic regions by other members of the Fusibacter genus. These physiological and genomic findings permit us to hypothesize the existence of an uncharacterized arsenate-dependent growth metabolism regulated by the cellular redox state in the Fusibacter genus.

The novel isolate was able to grow at 0–3% NaCl concentrations (w/v), pH 6.5–9.5, and 15–40 °C. The analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain KMU-158T belongs to the family Spongiibacteraceae and shared the highest similarity with Spongiibacter tropicus CL-CB221T (96.1%). The major cellular fatty acids were summed feature 3 (C16:1ω7c and/or C16:1ω6c) and C17:1ω8c. The only respiratory quinone was identified as ubiquinone-8. The polar lipids of strain KMU-158T contained phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, and two unidentified lipids. The assembled draft genome size of strain KMU-158T was 3.29 Mbp with a DNA G + C content of 51.3%. The average nucleotide identity, digital DNA–DNA hybridization, and average amino acid identity values of KMU-158T and the representatives of the genus Spongiibacter were found to be 78.5–79.1%, 13.8–14.1%, and 66.6–66.8%, respectively. From the distinct phenotypic, phylogenetic, genomic, and chemotaxonomic properties, the strain KMU-158T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Spongiibacter, for which the name Spongiibacter pelagi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the species S. pelagi sp. nov. is KMU-158T (= KCCM 90448T = NBRC 114307T). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Oxidative weathering of pyrite plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of Fe and S in terrestrial environments. While the mechanism and occurrence of biologically accelerated pyrite oxidation under acidic conditions are well established, much less is known about microbially mediated pyrite oxidation at circumneutral pH. Recent work (Percak-Dennett et al., 2017, Geobiology, 15, 690) has demonstrated the ability of aerobic chemolithotrophic microorganisms to accelerate pyrite oxidation at circumneutral pH and proposed two mechanistic models by which this phenomenon might occur. Here, we assess the potential relevance of aerobic microbially catalyzed circumneutral pH pyrite oxidation in relation to subsurface shale weathering at Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) in Pennsylvania, USA. Specimen pyrite mixed with native shale was incubated in groundwater for 3 months at the inferred depth of in situ pyrite oxidation. The colonized materials were used as an inoculum for pyrite-oxidizing enrichment cultures. Microbial activity accelerated the release of sulfate across all conditions. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analysis revealed the dominance of a putative chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium from the genus Thiobacillus in the enrichment cultures. Previously proposed models for aerobic microbial pyrite oxidation were assessed in terms of physical constraints, enrichment culture geochemistry, and metagenomic analysis. Although we conclude that subsurface pyrite oxidation at SSCHZO is largely abiotic, this work nonetheless yields new insight into the potential pathways by which aerobic microorganisms may accelerate pyrite oxidation at circumneutral pH. We propose a new “direct sulfur oxidation” pathway, whereby sulfhydryl-bearing outer membrane proteins mediate oxidation of pyrite surfaces through a persulfide intermediate, analogous to previously proposed mechanisms for direct microbial oxidation of elemental sulfur. The action of this and other direct microbial pyrite oxidation pathways have major implications for controls on pyrite weathering rates in circumneutral pH sedimentary environments where pore throat sizes permit widespread access of microorganisms to pyrite surfaces. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {The bioleaching process is carried out by aerobic acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria that are mainly mesophilic or moderately thermophilic. However, many mining sites are located in areas where the mean temperature is lower than the optimal growth temperature of these microorganisms. In this work, we report the obtaining and characterization of two psychrotolerant bioleaching bacterial strains from low-temperature sites that included an abandoned mine site in Chilean Patagonia (PG05) and an acid rock drainage in Marian Cove, King George Island in Antarctic (MC2.2). The PG05 and MC2.2 strains showed significant iron-oxidation activity and grew optimally at 20°C. Genome sequence analyses showed chromosomes of 2.76 and 2.84 Mbp for PG05 and MC2.2, respectively, and an average nucleotide identity estimation indicated that both strains clustered with the acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The Patagonian PG05 strain had a high content of genes coding for tolerance to metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Concordantly, electron microscopy revealed the intracellular presence of polyphosphate-like granules, likely involved in tolerance to metals and other stress conditions. The Antarctic MC2.2 strain showed a high dosage of genes for mercury resistance and low temperature adaptation. This report of cold-adapted cultures of the At. ferrooxidans species opens novel perspectives to satisfy the current challenges of the metal bioleaching industry.

	abstract = {The Cas1 protein is essential for the functioning of CRISPR-Cas adaptive systems. However, despite the high prevalence of CRISPR-Cas systems in thermophilic microorganisms, few studies have investigated the occurrence and diversity of Cas1 across hot spring microbial communities. Phylogenomic analysis of 2,150 Cas1 sequences recovered from 48 metagenomes representing hot springs (42–80°C, pH 6–9) from three continents, revealed similar ecological diversity of Cas1 and 16S rRNA associated with geographic location. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the Cas1 sequences exposed a broad taxonomic distribution in thermophilic bacteria, with new clades of Cas1 homologs branching at the root of the tree or at the root of known clades harboring reference Cas1 types. Additionally, a new family of casposases was identified from hot springs, which further completes the evolutionary landscape of the Cas1 superfamily. This ecological study contributes new Cas1 sequences from known and novel locations worldwide, mainly focusing on under-sampled hot spring microbial mat taxa. Results herein show that circumneutral hot springs are environments harboring high diversity and novelty related to adaptive immunity systems.

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification driven by land-use changes has caused continuous and cumulative soil acidification (SA) throughout the global agroecosystem. Microorganisms mediate acid-generating reactions; however, the microbial mechanisms responsible for exacerbating SA feedback remain largely unknown. To determine the microbial community composition and putative function associated with SA, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of soils across a chronosequence that has elapsed since the conversion of rice-wheat (RW) to rice-vegetable (RV) rotations. Compared to RW rotations, soil pH decreased by 0.50 and 1.56 units (p < 0.05) in response to 10-year and 20-year RV rotations, respectively. Additionally, acid saturation ratios were increased by 7.3% and 36.2% (p < 0.05), respectively. The loss of microbial beta-diversity was a key element that contributed to the exacerbation of SA in the RV. Notably, the 20-year RV-enriched microbial taxa were more hydrogen (H+)-, aluminium (Al3+)-, and nitrate nitrogen (NO3−-N) -dependent and contained more genera exhibiting dehydrogenation functions than did RW-enriched taxa. “M00115, M00151, M00417, and M00004” and “M00531 and M00135” that are the “proton-pumping” and “proton-consuming” gene modules, respectively, were linked to the massive recruitment of acid-dependent biomarkers in 20-year RV soils, particularly Rhodanobacter, Gemmatirosa, Sphingomonas, and Streptomyces. Collectively, soils in long-term RV rotations were highly acidified and acid-sensitive, as the enrichment of microbial dehydrogenation genes allowing for soil buffering capacity is more vulnerable to H+ loading and consequently promotes the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic microbes, and ultimately provide new clues for researchers to elucidate the interaction between SA and the soil microbiome. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The diversity and composition of bacterial taxa and their functional genes differed significantly (p < 0.01) among the compartments. Among 31,117 functional genes detected, some were exclusively recorded in one sporocarp compartment: 1,334 genes involved in carbon (mdh) and nitrogen fixation (nifH) in the context; 524 genes influencing carbon (apu) and sulfite reduction (dsrB, dsra) in the hymenophore; and 255 genes involved in sulfur oxidation (soxB and soxC) and polyphosphate degradation (ppx) in the pileipellis.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of pH on bacterial resistance mechanisms to copper (Cu) stress by genomic and transcriptomic analysis. Klebsiella michiganensis cells were exposed to 0.5 mM CuCl2 at pH 4 and 5. Lower pH (pH < 4) strongly inhibited K. michiganensis growth, while Cu stress and higher pH (pH > 5) induced Cu precipitation in the medium. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that two groups of genes related to quorum sensing (QS) systems (lsrABCDFGKR) and type II secretion systems (T2SS) (gspCDEFGHIJKLM) were significantly up-regulated at pH 4 only. These results suggest that T2SS may be induced and controlled by QS, thereby contributing to the formation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the secretion of proteins to prevent Cu ions from entering cells. Six Cu resistance genes (cusABF, copA, cueO, and gene05308) were more significantly up-regulated at pH 4 than at pH 5. In addition, the relative expression (log2|FC=) of the sulfur assimilation genes cysHJIK was relatively higher at pH 4 than at pH 5, while the gene encoding organic sulfur metabolism, tauB, was also significantly up-regulated at only pH 4. These results indicate that the Cu efflux system can remove intracellular Cu ions from cells, and that the sulfur assimilation system is related to the detoxification of Cu ions. Furthermore, increased free Cu ions at lower pH (4) could induce communication signals among cells, thereby stimulating the response of T2SS-related genes in K. michiganensis to tolerate Cu stress. Consequently, the resistance of K. michiganensis to Cu stress is a multisystem collaborative process composed of intracellular and extracellular components. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Protein O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (O-GlcNAcylation) is a unique monosaccharide modification discovered in the early 1980s. With the technological advances in the past several decades, great progress has been made to reveal the biochemistry of O-GlcNAcylation, the substrates of O-GlcNAcylation, and the functional importance of protein O-GlcNAcylation. As a nutrient sensor, protein O-GlcNAcylation plays important roles in almost all biochemical processes examined. Although the functional importance of O-GlcNAcylation of proteins has been extensively reviewed previously, the chemical and biochemical aspects have not been fully addressed. In this review, by critically evaluating key publications in the past 35 years, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of this important post-translational modification (PTM) from analytical and biochemical perspectives. Specifically, we will cover (1) multiple analytical advances in the characterization of O-GlcNAc cycling components (i.e., the substrate donor UDP-GlcNAc, the two key enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase, and O-GlcNAc substrate proteins), (2) the biochemical characterization of the enzymes with a variety of chemical tools, and (3) exploration of O-GlcNAc cycling and its modulating chemicals as potential biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for diseases. Last but not least, we will discuss the challenges and possible solutions for basic and translational research of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {One of the current aims of synthetic biology is the development of novel microorganisms that can mine economically important elements from the environment or remediate toxic waste compounds. Copper, in particular, is a high-priority target for bioremediation owing to its extensive use in the food, metal and electronic industries and its resulting common presence as an environmental pollutant. Even though microbe-Aided copper biomining is a mature technology, its application to waste treatment and remediation of contaminated sites still requires further research and development. Crucially, any engineered copper-remediating chassis must survive in copper-rich environments and adapt to copper toxicity; they also require bespoke adaptations to specifically extract copper and safely accumulate it as a human-recoverable deposit to enable biorecycling. Here, we review current strategies in copper bioremediation, biomining and biorecycling, as well as strategies that extant bacteria use to enhance copper tolerance, accumulation and mineralization in the native environment. By describing the existing toolbox of copper homeostasis proteins from naturally occurring bacteria, we show how these modular systems can be exploited through synthetic biology to enhance the properties of engineered microbes for biotechnological copper recovery applications.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus species are fundamental players in biofilm formation by acidophile bioleaching communities. It has been previously reported that Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans possesses a functional quorum sensing mediated by acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL), involved in biofilm formation, and AHLs naturally produced by Acidithiobacillus species also induce biofilm formation in Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. A c-di-GMP pathway has been characterized in Acidithiobacillus species but it has been pointed out that the c-di-GMP effector PelD and pel-like operon are only present in the sulfur oxidizers such as A. thiooxidans. PEL exopolysaccharide has been recently involved in biofilm formation in this Acidithiobacillus species. Here, by comparing wild type and ∆pelD strains through mechanical analysis of biofilm-cells detachment, fluorescence microscopy and qPCR experiments, the structural role of PEL exopolysaccharide and the molecular network involved for its biosynthesis by A. thiooxidans were tackled. Besides, the effect of AHLs on PEL exopolysaccharide production was assessed. Mechanical resistance experiments indicated that the loss of PEL exopolysaccharide produces fragile A. thiooxidans biofilms. qRT-PCR analysis established that AHLs induce the transcription of pelA and pelD genes while epifluorescence microscopy studies revealed that PEL exopolysaccharide was required for the development of AHL-induced biofilms. Altogether these results reveal for the first time that AHLs positively regulate pel genes and participate in the molecular network for PEL exopolysaccharide biosynthesis by A. thiooxidans. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The multi-domain bacterial S1 protein is the largest and most functionally important ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit, which interacts with both mRNA and proteins. The family of ribosomal S1 proteins differs in the classical sense from a protein with tandem repeats and has a “bead-on-string” organization, where each repeat is folded into a globular domain. Based on our recent data, the study of evolutionary relationships for the bacterial phyla will provide evidence for one of the proposed theories of the evolutionary development of proteins with structural repeats: from multiple repeats of assembles to single repeats, or vice versa. In this comparative analysis of 1333 S1 sequences that were identified in 24 different phyla, we demonstrate how such phyla can form independently/dependently during evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study of the evolutionary history of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins. The collected and structured data can be useful to computer biologists as a resource for determining percent identity, amino acid composition and logo motifs, as well as dN/dS ratio in bacterial S1 protein. The obtained research data indicate that the evolutionary development of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins evolved from multiple assemblies to single repeat.

	abstract = {Sediment microbial community plays a crucial role in aquaculture ecosystem. In aquaculture practice, rather than monoculture intensive shrimp (IS) or intensive fish (IF) patterns, polyculture of shrimp and fish (PolySF) pattern leads to a more reliable production. However, knowledge is still limited about the characteristics of sediment microbiota and its potential functions in the PolySF ponds compared to monoculture patterns (IS and IF). Herein, we collected sediment samples from these three patterns in seven cities to evaluate microbial variations among patterns. The highest oxidation reduction potential (ORP), total phosphate (TP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were detected in the PolySF pattern, representing a relatively less anoxic environment, while the highest iron (Fe) was detected in IS pattern. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum among three patterns, followed by Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi. The microbial alpha diversity in the PolySF was higher than those in the IF, but lower than those in the IS. Microbial communities of these three patterns were significantly distinct from each other, and 23 distinguished taxa for each pattern were further characterized. In additional, the relative abundances of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways were markedly shifted. Moreover, ORP, TOC and Fe were the shaping factors for sediment microbiota, which significantly varied among three patterns. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that sediment microbial communities in the PolySF were distinctive from those in the IS and IF, which enlarged our understanding for the underlying mechanism of advances in the PolySF pattern from ecological perspective. © 2021},

	abstract = {In the multiomics era, comparative genomics studies based on gene repertoire comparison are increasingly used to investigate evolutionary histories of species, to study genotype–phenotype relations, species adaptation to various environments, or to predict gene function using phylogenetic profiling. However, comparisons of orthologs have highlighted the prevalence of sequence plasticity among species, showing the benefits of combining protein and subprotein levels of analysis to allow for a more comprehensive study of genotype/phenotype correlations. In this article, we introduce a new approach called BLUR (BLAST Unexpected Ranking), capable of detecting genotype divergence or specialization between two related clades at different levels: gain/loss of proteins but also of subprotein regions. These regions can correspond to known domains, uncharacterized regions, or even small motifs. Our method was created to allow two types of research strategies: 1) the comparison of two groups of species with no previous knowledge, with the aim of predicting phenotype differences or specializations between close species or 2) the study of specific phenotypes by comparing species that present the phenotype of interest with species that do not. We designed a website to facilitate the use of BLUR with a possibility of in-depth analysis of the results with various tools, such as functional enrichments, protein–protein interaction networks, and multiple sequence alignments. We applied our method to the study of two different biological pathways and to the comparison of several groups of close species, all with very promising results.

These systems are phylogenetically and functionally diverse, but feature a common and strictly conserved active site. The heterobimetallic active sites of these enzymes feature an unusual combination of organometallic and bioinorganic coordination chemistry that can only be achieved with the careful spatial positioning provided by the protein geometry. The immediate secondary sphere offers hydrogen bonding partners, hydrophobic pockets, proton transfer pathways, and Lewis-basic residues to position substrates, while the supporting auxiliary iron-sulfur clusters modulate catalytic bias; the global protein structure provides substrate channels, and the distal interactions also tune catalysis. These interactions synergistically combine to give the high levels of activity observed in the natural systems. Synthetic inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry has capitalized on fundamental biochemical studies to build systems that reproduce key structural, spectroscopic, and functional properties of the native enzymes, and ongoing research indicates the importance of the [NiFe] hydrogenases for implementing anthropogenic hydrogen conversion.   © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Coal mine derived acid mine drainage (AMD) is formed when oxygenated water infiltrates mine voids and oxidizes FeS phases, generating acidic fluid rich in heavy metals, polluting thousands of miles of streams. Existing remediation options are cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain. In some cases, AMD flows over previously pristine soil in thin sheets over terrestrial surface, enhancing AMD aeration and Fe(II) oxidizing activities, leading to oxidative Fe(II) precipitation from AMD, without any human intervention. Since robust Fe(II) biooxidation occurs in the mixture of intruding AMD and pristine soil, understanding the effects of chemically variant AMD can be exploited for effective Fe(II) removal. We hypothesized that chemistry and microbiology of AMD intruding pristine soil on surface would influence the development of Fe(II) oxidizing capabilities. Therefore, to investigate the response of pristine soil to the addition of AMD varying in chemical and microbial characteristics, we mixed soil with a near-neutral and moderately acidic AMD, in separate incubations. Incubations with near-neutral AMD developed microbial Fe(II) oxidation activities after 10 days. However, Fe(II) oxidation in moderately acidic AMD incubations was mostly abiotic. 16S rRNA gene sequences and metabolic functional prediction (Tax4Fun) analysis of near-neutral AMD and soil mixture indicated development of taxonomically different communities capable of activities similar to microorganisms in a mine void. In conclusion, results indicate that AMD chemistry and microbiology affects development of Fe(II) biooxidation. Therefore, understanding of the effect of AMD chemistry on the development of FeOB activities in soil can be exploited to design site-specific and sustainable solutions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {DPANN is known as highly diverse, globally widespread, and mostly ectosymbiotic archaeal superphylum. However, this group of archaea was overlooked for a long time, and there were limited in-depth studies reported. In this investigation, 41 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to the DPANN superphylum were recovered (18 MAGs had average nucleotide identity [ANI] values of ,95% and a percentage of conserved proteins [POCP] of .50%, while 14 MAGs showed a POCP of ,50%), which were analyzed comparatively with 515 other published DPANN genomes. Mismatches to known 16S rRNA gene primers were identified among 16S rRNA genes of DPANN archaea. Numbers of gene families lost (mostly related to energy and amino acid metabolism) were over three times greater than those gained in the evolution of DPANN archaea. Lateral gene transfer (LGT; ;45.5% was cross-domain) had facilitated niche adaption of the DPANN archaea, ensuring a delicate equilibrium of streamlined genomes with efficient niche-adaptive strategies. For instance, LGT-derived cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase and arginine deiminase in the genomes of "Candidatus Micrarchaeota"could help them better adapt to aerobic acidic mine drainage habitats. In addition, most DPANN archaea acquired enzymes for biosynthesis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and transketolase/transaldolase for the pentose phosphate pathway from Bacteria. © 2021 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Bioelectrocatalysis is an interdisciplinary research field combining biocatalysis and electrocatalysis via the utilization of materials derived from biological systems as catalysts to catalyze the redox reactions occurring at an electrode. Bioelectrocatalysis synergistically couples the merits of both biocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The advantages of biocatalysis include high activity, high selectivity, wide substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions. The advantages of electrocatalysis include the possible utilization of renewable electricity as an electron source and high energy conversion efficiency. These properties are integrated to achieve selective biosensing, efficient energy conversion, and the production of diverse products. This review seeks to systematically and comprehensively detail the fundamentals, analyze the existing problems, summarize the development status and applications, and look toward the future development directions of bioelectrocatalysis. First, the structure, function, and modification of bioelectrocatalysts are discussed. Second, the essentials of bioelectrocatalytic systems, including electron transfer mechanisms, electrode materials, and reaction medium, are described. Third, the application of bioelectrocatalysis in the fields of biosensors, fuel cells, solar cells, catalytic mechanism studies, and bioelectrosyntheses of high-value chemicals are systematically summarized. Finally, future developments and a perspective on bioelectrocatalysis are suggested.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The characterization of microbial functional diversity proffers the opportunity to understand and manipulate them in various agricultural and biotechnological processes. This study analyzed the functional diversity and metabolic potentials of microbial communities in the rhizosphere of a former grassland and an intensively cultivated land using a shotgun metagenomic approach. We assumed that functional diversity will vary between the two maize fields and that each soil has an active metabolic profile that differentiates it from the other. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from the rhizosphere, and bulk soil samples from maize fields and sequencing was performed using the shotgun method. The results showed that 14 functional categories were dominant in the former grassland rhizosphere, while 12 functions predominated the intensively cultivated land. In the subsystems at level 2, potassium metabolism was the most abundant functional category with the highest relative abundance of 21.32% observed in GZ3. No significant difference was observed in the alpha diversity studies between the two fields, the Kruskal-Wallis test also revealed an insignificant difference (p = 0.99) in the diversity levels of samples, while 0.51 and 0.01 were obtained as the R- and p-values, respectively from the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) performed. Nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3) was the most influential physicochemical parameter, with a p-value of 0.01 and a contribution % of 81.7%. Furthermore, the high abundance of unknown functions explains that the maize microbiome is still underexplored. Identifying the microbial communities with these functions will help in modeling them to harvest their unique functional benefits for agricultural productivity enhancement. © 2020},

	abstract = {The use of the biological agents for leaching heavy metals from contaminated soils is a very promising method that is both efficient and eco-friendly. In this study, a fungus Aspergillus tubingensis F12 was reported to possess a strong adsorption capacity for various heavy metal ions and shown to adsorb 90.8% Pb, 68.4% Zn, 64.5% Cr, 13.1% Cu, 12.9% Ni, and 6.9% Cd in aqueous solution. As extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) was found to play a leading role in the adsorption of metal ions, we applied EPS as a leaching agent to simultaneously remove six metals from soil in a column leaching experiment. The flow rate, initial solution pH, initial EPS concentration, and ionic strength were investigated using response surface methodology. The minimum and maximum metal leaching capacities were determined to be 0.089 mg/g and 3.703 mg/g, respectively. Verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we made the preliminary deductions that ion exchange determines the leaching capacity limit and that biosorption plays a large role in reaching that limit. Additionally, the redox behaviour of Cu produced more carboxyl groups, which increased the adsorption of heavy metals. The ecological impact of this method was also examined; we found that the influences of leaching with EPS on soil properties and microbial community structure were slight. Therefore, the reported leaching process might have application prospects for metal removal from soil. © 2020},

	abstract = {A novel Gram-staining-positive, short rod-shaped, non-motile, and non-pigmented actinobacterial strain (KIGAM211T) was isolated from kaolinite, a soft white clay mineral, collected from Sancheong in the Republic of Korea. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain KIGAM211T was determined to belong to the genus Nocardioides and was most closely related to N. ungokensis UKS-03T (97.5% similarity). Cells could grow between 4 and 35 °C (optimum 30 °C), 0–3% (w/v) NaCl concentration (optimum 0%) and pH 5.5–8.5 (optimum 7.0) on R2A agar. Morphological appearance of colonies was cream-white, arranged singly or in groups. Biochemical characterization of strain KAGAM211T indicated that it could hydrolyze casein, gelatin, Tweens 40 and tyrosine. Furthermore, the strain was positive for both oxidase and catalase activity. Strain KIGAM211T was characterized chemotaxonomically by MK-8 (H4) as the predominant menaquinone and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) as the major polar lipids. Major fatty acids were iso-C16:0 and C18:1ω9c. The Ortholog average nucleotide identity (OrthoANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) values between strain KIGAM211T and its most closely related strains of the Nocardioides genus were < 82% and < 24%, respectively, suggesting that strain KIGAM211T represent a novel species. The whole genome size of KIGAM211T was 4.52 Mb, comprising a total of 4,294 genes with DNA G + C content of 72.3 mol%. The genome of strain KIGAM211T also comprises the biosynthetic gene cluster for alkylresorcinol as secondary metabolite. The results of physiological, taxonomical, phylogenetic, and whole genome analyses allowed for differentiation of strain KIGAM211T from the recognized Nocardioides species. Therefore, strain KIGAM211T is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Nocardioides luti sp. nov. (type strain KIGAM211T = KCTC 49364T = JCM 33859T) is proposed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a facultative anaerobe that depends on ferrous ion oxidation as well as reduced sulfur oxidation to obtain energy and is widely applied in metallurgy, environmental protection, and soil remediation. With the accumulation of experimental data, metabolic mechanisms, kinetic models, and several databases have been established. However, scattered data are not conducive to understanding A. ferrooxidans that necessitates updated information informed by systems biology. Results: Here, we constructed a knowledgebase of iron metabolism of A. ferrooxidans (KIMAf) system by integrating public databases and reviewing the literature, including the database of bioleaching substrates (DBS), the database of bioleaching metallic ion-related proteins (MIRP), the A. ferrooxidans bioinformation database (Af-info), and the database for dynamics model of bioleaching (DDMB). The DBS and MIRP incorporate common bioleaching substrates and metal ion-related proteins. Af-info and DDMB integrate nucleotide, gene, protein, and kinetic model information. Statistical analysis was performed to elucidate the distribution of isolated A. ferrooxidans strains, evolutionary and metabolic advances, and the development of bioleaching models. Conclusions: This comprehensive system provides researchers with a platform of available iron metabolism-related resources of A. ferrooxidans and facilitates its application.

	abstract = {To explore the potential role of tetrathionate in the sedimentary sulfur cycle, population ecology of microorganisms capable of metabolizing this polythionate was revealed at 15-30 cm resolution along two,3m long, cores collected from 530 and 580m below the sea level, off India's west coast, within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the Arabian Sea. Metagenome analysis along the cores revealed widespread occurrence of genes involved in the formation, oxidation, and reduction of tetrathionate; high diversity and relative abundance were also detected for bacteria that are known to render these metabolisms in vitro. Results of slurry culture of the sediment samples in thiosulfate-or tetrathionate-containing microbial growth media, data obtained via pure-culture isolation, and finally metatranscriptome analyses corroborated the in situ functionality of the tetrathionate-forming, tetrathionate-oxidizing, and tetrathionate-reducing microorganisms. Ion chromatography of pore waters revealed the presence of up to 11.1μ M thiosulfate in the two cores, whereas tetrathionate remained undetected in spectroscopic assay based on its reaction with cyanide. While thiosulfate oxidation by chemolithotrophic bacteria prevalent in situ is the apparent source of tetrathionate in this ecosystem, high biochemical and geochemical reactivity of this polythionate could be instrumental in its cryptic status in the sulfur cycle. Potential abiotic origin of tetrathionate in the sediment horizon explored could neither be ruled out nor confirmed from the geochemical information available. On the other hand, tetrathionate potentially present in the system can be either oxidized to sulfate or reduced back to thiosulfate/sulfide via chemolithotrophic oxidation and respiration by native bacterial populations, respectively. Up to 2.01mM sulfide present in the sediment cores may also reduce tetrathionate abiotically to thiosulfate and elemental sulfur. However, in the absence of measured data for O2 or other oxyanions having possibilities of serving as electron acceptors, the biogeochemical modalities of the oxidative half of the tetrathionate cycle remained unresolved.  © Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Manganese is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. The oxidation of manganese has long been theorized1—yet has not been demonstrated2–4—to fuel the growth of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. Here we refine an enrichment culture that exhibits exponential growth dependent on Mn(II) oxidation to a co-culture of two microbial species. Oxidation required viable bacteria at permissive temperatures, which resulted in the generation of small nodules of manganese oxide with which the cells associated. The majority member of the culture—which we designate ‘Candidatus Manganitrophus noduliformans’—is affiliated to the phylum Nitrospirae (also known as Nitrospirota), but is distantly related to known species of Nitrospira and Leptospirillum. We isolated the minority member, a betaproteobacterium that does not oxidize Mn(II) alone, and designate it Ramlibacter lithotrophicus. Stable-isotope probing revealed 13CO2 fixation into cellular biomass that was dependent upon Mn(II) oxidation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed candidate pathways for coupling extracellular manganese oxidation to aerobic energy conservation and autotrophic CO2 fixation. These findings expand the known diversity of inorganic metabolisms that support life, and complete a biogeochemical energy cycle for manganese5,6 that may interface with other major global elemental cycles. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Nitrate reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation (NRFO) has been recognized as an environmentally important microbial process in many freshwater ecosystems. However, well-characterized examples of autotrophic nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria are rare, and their pathway of electron transfer as well as their interaction with flanking community members remain largely unknown. Here, we applied meta-omics (i.e., metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics) to the nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing enrichment culture KS growing under autotrophic or heterotrophic conditions and originating from freshwater sediment. We constructed four metagenome-assembled genomes with an estimated completeness of $95%, including the key players of NRFO in culture KS, identified as Gallionellaceae sp. and Rhodanobacter sp. The Gallionellaceae sp. and Rhodanobacter sp. transcripts and proteins likely involved in Fe(II) oxidation (e.g., mtoAB, cyc2, and mofA), denitrification (e.g., napGHI), and oxidative phosphorylation (e.g., respiratory chain complexes I to V) along with Gallionellaceae sp. transcripts and proteins for carbon fixation (e.g., rbcL) were detected. Overall, our results indicate that in culture KS, the Gallionellaceae sp. and Rhodanobacter sp. are interdependent: while Gallionellaceae sp. fixes CO2 and provides organic compounds for Rhodanobacter sp., Rhodanobacter sp. likely detoxifies NO through NO reduction and completes denitrification, which cannot be performed by Gallionellaceae sp. alone. Additionally, the transcripts and partial proteins of cbb3- and aa3-type cytochrome c suggest the possibility for a microaerophilic lifestyle of the Gallionellaceae sp., yet culture KS grows under anoxic conditions. Our findings demonstrate that autotrophic NRFO is performed through cooperation among denitrifying and Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, which might resemble microbial interactions in freshwater environments. IMPORTANCE Nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria are widespread in the environment, contribute to nitrate removal, and influence the fate of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and not fully understood. The most prominent model system for this type of study is the enrichment culture KS. To gain insights into the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen, we performed metagenomic, metatranscrip-tomic, and metaproteomic analyses of culture KS and identified Gallionellaceae sp. and Rhodanobacter sp. as interdependent key Fe(II) oxidizers in culture KS. Our work demonstrates that autotrophic nitrate reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation is not performed by an individual strain but is a cooperation of at least two members of the bacterial community in culture KS. These findings serve as a foundation for our understanding of nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria in the environment. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Members of the genus Metallosphaera are widely found in sulfur-rich and metal-laden environments, but their physiological and ecological roles remain poorly understood. Here, we sequenced Metallosphaera tengchongensis Ric-A, a strain isolated from the Tengchong hot spring in Yunnan Province, China, and performed a comparative genome analysis with other Metallosphaera genomes. The genome of M. tengchongensis had an average nucleotide identity (ANI) of approximately 70% to that of Metallosphaera cuprina. Genes sqr, tth, sir, tqo, hdr, tst, soe, and sdo associated with sulfur oxidation, and gene clusters fox and cbs involved in iron oxidation existed in all Metallosphaera genomes. However, the adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (APS) pathway was only detected in Metallosphaera sedula and Metallosphaera yellowstonensis, and several subunits of fox cluster were lost in M. cuprina. The complete 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle and dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle involved in carbon fixation were found in all Metallosphaera genomes. A large number of gene family gain events occurred in M. yellowstonensis and M. sedula, whereas gene family loss events occurred frequently in M. cuprina. Pervasive strong purifying selection was found acting on the gene families of Metallosphaera, of which transcription-related genes underwent the strongest purifying selection. In contrast, genes related to prophages, transposons, and defense mechanisms were under weaker purifying pressure. Taken together, this study expands knowledge of the genomic traits of Metallosphaera species and sheds light on their evolution. © Copyright © 2020 Wang, Li, Qin, Liang, Li, Yin, Liu, Liu and Jiang.},

	abstract = {Strain MD1T is an anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative bacterium isolated from a lab-scale biogas fermenter fed with maize silage. It has a rod-shaped morphology with peritrichously arranged appendages and forms long chains of cells and coccoid structures. The colonies of MD1T were white, circular, slightly convex and had a smooth rim. The isolate is meso-philic, displaying growth between 25 and 45 °C with an optimum at 40 °C. It grew at pH values of pH 6.7–8.2 (optimum, pH 7.1) and tolerated the addition of up to 1.5% (w/v) NaCl to the medium. The main cellular fatty acids of MD1T are C14:0 DMA and C16:0 . Strain MD1T fermented xylose, arabinose, glucose, galactose, cellobiose, maltose, maltodextrin10, lactose starch, and xylan, producing mainly 2-propanol and acetic acid. The genome of the organism has a total length of 4163427 bp with a G+C content of 38.5 mol%. The two closest relatives to MD1T are Mobilitalea sibirica P3M-3T and Anaerotaenia torta FH052T with 96.44 or 95.8 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and POCP values of 46.58 and 50.58%, respectively. As MD1T showed saccharolytic and xylanolytic properties, it may play an important role in the biogas fermentation process. Closely related variants of MD1T were also abundant in microbial communities involved in methanogenic fermentation. Based on morphological, phylogenetic and genomic data, the isolated strain can be considered as representing a novel genus in the family Lachnospiraceae, for which the name Variimorphobacter saccharofermentans gen. nov., sp. nov.

	abstract = {CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with an adaptive immune system that targets foreign DNA. However, the xenogenic nature of immunity provided by CRISPR-Cas raises the possibility that these systems may constrain horizontal gene transfer. Here we test this hypothesis in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has emerged as an important model system for understanding CRISPR-Cas function. Across the diversity of P. aeruginosa, active CRISPR-Cas systems are associated with smaller genomes and higher GC content, suggesting that CRISPR-Cas inhibits the acquisition of foreign DNA. Although phage is the major target of CRISPR-Cas spacers, more than 80% of isolates with an active CRISPR-Cas system have spacers that target integrative conjugative elements (ICE) or the conserved conjugative transfer machinery used by plasmids and ICE. Consistent with these results, genomes containing active CRISPR-Cas systems harbour a lower abundance of both prophage and ICE. Crucially, spacers in genomes with active CRISPR-Cas systems map to ICE and phage that are integrated into the chromosomes of closely related genomes lacking CRISPR-Cas immunity. We propose that CRISPR-Cas acts as an important constraint to horizontal gene transfer, and the evolutionary mechanisms that ensure its maintenance or drive its loss are key to the ability of this pathogen to adapt to new niches and stressors. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Mine 1 exhibited lower contents of total soluble sulfur compounds and reactive soluble sulfur compounds (oxidation state < + VI) relative to Mine 2. Mine 1 also exhibited greater wastewater microbial community diversity with more unique sequences than Mine 2, resulting in clear NMDS differentiation and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between the two mines’ microbial communities. Proteobacteria dominated all wastewater samples and enrichment communities, ranging between 58–99% of the total of sequences retrieved from the corresponding samples. However, a shift in dominance occurred from primarily Alphaproteobacteria (28–77%) in the circumneutral wastewater communities to Gammaproteobacteria (> 80%) in the moderately acidic enrichment communities. A further pH dependent shift occurred from Halothiobacillus spp. dominating the pH 7–5 enrichments to Thiomonas spp. dominating the pH 5–3 enrichments.

S3 that was previously isolated from antimony-contaminated soil displayed high Sb(III) resistance and Sb(III) oxidation efficiency. However, the genomic information and evolutionary feature of Bacillus sp. S3 are very scarce. Results: Here, we identified a 5,436,472 bp chromosome with 40.30% GC content and a 241,339 bp plasmid with 36.74% GC content in the complete genome of Bacillus sp. S3. Genomic annotation showed that Bacillus sp. S3 contained a key aioB gene potentially encoding As (III)/Sb(III) oxidase, which was not shared with other Bacillus strains. Furthermore, a wide variety of genes associated with Sb(III) and other heavy metal (loid) s were also ascertained in Bacillus sp. S3, reflecting its adaptive advantage for growth in the harsh eco-environment. Based on the analysis of phylogenetic relationship and the average nucleotide identities (ANI), Bacillus sp. S3 was proved to a novel species within the Bacillus genus. The majority of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) mainly distributed on chromosomes within the Bacillus genus. Pan-genome analysis showed that the 45 genomes contained 554 core genes and many unique genes were dissected in analyzed genomes. Whole genomic alignment showed that Bacillus genus underwent frequently large-scale evolutionary events. In addition, the origin and evolution analysis of Sb(III)-resistance genes revealed the evolutionary relationships and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events among the Bacillus genus. The assessment of functionality of heavy metal (loid) s resistance genes emphasized its indispensable role in the harsh eco-environment of Bacillus genus. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that Sb(III)-related genes were all induced under the Sb(III) stress, while arsC gene was down-regulated. Conclusions: The results in this study shed light on the molecular mechanisms of Bacillus sp. S3 coping with Sb(III), extended our understanding on the evolutionary relationships between Bacillus sp. S3 and other closely related species, and further enriched the Sb(III) resistance genetic data sources. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Whole genome sequencing of Lysinibacillus pakistanensis LZH-9 and comparative genomic analysis revealed metabolic versatility of different species of Lysinibacillus, and abundant genes involved in xenobiotics biodegradation, resistance to toxic compound, and salinity were found in all tested species of Lysinibacillus, in which Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) contributed to the acquisition of many important properties of Lysinibacillus spp. such as toxic compound resistance and osmotic stress resistance as revealed by phylogenetic analyses. Besides, genome wide positive selection analyses revealed seven genes that contained adaptive mutations in Lysinibacillus spp., most of which were multifunctional. Further expression assessment with Codon Adaption Index (CAI) also reflected the high metabolic rate of L. pakistanensis to digest potential carbon or nitrogen sources in organic contaminants, which was closely linked with efficient COD removal ability of strain LZH-9. The high COD removal efficiency and halotolerance as well as genomic evidences suggested that L. pakistanensis LZH-9 was promising in treating hypersaline industrial wastewater. © 2020 by the authors.

We have shown that: (i) CX 2–6 can tolerate cadmium (Cd) with a slower growth rate; (ii) The CX 2–6 complete genome is fully assembled using PacBio long reads; (iii) Differential expression analysis found 47% of CX 2–6 genes are significantly affected by Cd treatment and form three gene groups with distinct expression profiles; (iv) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) form physically linked gene clusters in the CX 2–6 genome, and one of the gene clusters corresponds to a prophage that is unique to CX 2–6 and is strongly activated when Cd concentration is higher; (v) A majority of DEGs responding to Cd treatment are present in the core genome; and (vi) 55 noncoding RNA genes are identified and 49 of them are DEGs responding to cadmium stress.

	abstract = {The use of microorganisms in mining processes is a technology widely employed around the world. Leaching bacteria are characterized by having resistance mechanisms for several metals found in their acidic environments, some of which have been partially described in the Acidithiobacillus genus (mainly on ferrooxidans species). However, the response to copper has not been studied in the psychrotolerant Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans strains. Therefore, we propose to elucidate the response mechanisms of A. ferrivorans ACH to high copper concentrations (0–800 mM), describing its genetic repertoire and transcriptional regulation. Our results show that A. ferrivorans ACH can grow in up to 400 mM of copper. Moreover, we found the presence of several copper-related makers, belonging to cop and cus systems, as well as rusticyanins and periplasmatic acop protein in the genome. Interestingly, the ACH strain is the only one in which we find three copies of copB and copZ genes. Moreover, transcriptional expression showed an up-regulation response (acop, copZ, cusA, rusA, and rusB) to high copper concentrations. Finally, our results support the important role of these genes in A. ferrivorans copper stress resistance, promoting the use of the ACH strain in industrial leaching under low temperatures, which could decrease the activation times of oxidation processes and the energy costs. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Motivation: Genomes sequencing has become the primary (and often the sole) experimental method to characterize newly discovered organisms, in particular from the microbial world (bacteria, archaea, viruses). This generates an ever increasing number of predicted proteins the existence of which is unwarranted, in particular among those without homolog in model organisms. As a last resort, the computation of the selection pressure from pairwise alignments of the corresponding 'Open Reading Frames' (ORFs) can be used to validate their existences. However, this approach is error-prone, as not usually associated with a significance test. Results: We introduce the use of the straightforward Fisher's exact test as a postprocessing of the results provided by the popular CODEML sequence comparison software. The respective rates of nucleotide changes at the nonsynonymous versus synonymous position (as determined by CODEML) are turned into entries into a 2 × 2 contingency table, the probability of which is computed under the Null hypothesis that they should not behave differently if the ORFs do not encode actual proteins. Using the genome sequences of two recently isolated giant viruses, we show that strong negative selection pressures do not always provide a solid argument in favor of the existence of proteins.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Copper (Cu) is a widely used antimicrobial treatment for various plant diseases, including those affecting X. fastidiosa hosts. Cu homeostasis among X. fastidiosa strains from different geographical locations and host species has not been characterized. Here, we assessed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cu for 54 X. fastidiosa strains. We observed strain-level variation in MIC values within each subspecies. We hypothesized that these differences could be explained by sequence variation in Cu homeostasis genes. Phylogenies based on copA, copB, copL, and cutC were created using 74 genomes (including 43 strains used in vitro) of X. fastidiosa, showing that the phylogenetic clustering of Cu homeostasis associated with clustering was based on core genome phylogenies, rather than on pattern of MIC. No association was found among Cu MIC, subspecies classification, and host and location of isolation, probably due to uneven and limited group of strains whose genomes are available. Further analysis focused on a subgroup of isolates from Georgia’s vineyards that shared similar Cu-related phenotypes. Further research is needed to better understand the distribution of Cu homeostasis for this pathogen. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The sequencing methods, assembly and annotation strategies of A. cerana abansis were more comprehensive than previously published A. cerana genomes. Then, the intraspecific genetic diversity of A. cerana was revealed at the genomic level. We re-identified the repeat content in the genome of A. cerana abansis, as well as the other three A. cerana strains. The chemosensory and immune-related proteins in different A. cerana strains were carefully re-identified, so that 132 odorant receptor subfamilies, 12 gustatory receptor subfamilies and 22 immune-related pathways were found. We also discovered that, compared with other published genomes, the A. cerana abansis lost the largest number of chemoreceptors compared to other strains, and hypothesized that gene loss/gain might help different A. cerana strains to adapt to their respective environments.

SAINT GOBAIN materials exhibited a higher adsorption potential under abiotic conditions, a higher buffer capacity and a superior performance compared to conventional plastic rings when implemented in biotrickling filters operating at gas residence times as low as 7.5 s. Among the materials tested in biofilters, Filtralite Air AC supported almost complete H2S and toluene removals at a gas residence time of 20 s, while successfully eliminating methylmercaptan at values of ~80%.

	abstract = {The pathogen Xylella fastidiosa belongs to the Xanthomonadaceae family, a large group of Gram-negative bacteria that cause diseases in many economically important crops. A predicted gene, annotated as glutaredoxin-like protein (glp), was found to be highly conserved among the genomes of different genera within this family and highly expressed in X. fastidiosa. Analysis of the GLP protein sequences revealed three protein domains: one similar to monothiol glutaredoxins (Grx), an Fe-S cluster and a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase/rhodanese domain (Tst/Rho), which is generally involved in sulfur metabolism and cyanide detoxification. To characterize the biochemical properties of GLP, we expressed and purified the X. fastidiosa recombinant GLP enzyme. Grx activity and Fe-S cluster formation were not observed, while an evaluation of Tst/Rho enzymatic activity revealed that GLP can detoxify cyanide and transfer inorganic sulfur to acceptor molecules in vitro. The biological activity of GLP relies on the cysteine residues in the Grx and Tst/Rho domains (Cys33 and Cys266, respectively), and structural analysis showed that GLP and GLPC266S were able to form high molecular weight oligomers (> 600 kDa), while replacement of Cys33 with Ser destabilized the quaternary structure. In vivo heterologous enzyme expression experiments in Escherichia coli revealed that GLP can protect bacteria against high concentrations of cyanide and hydrogen peroxide. Finally, phylogenetic analysis showed that homologous glp genes are distributed across Gram-negative bacterial families with conservation of the N- to C-domain order. However, no eukaryotic organism contains this enzyme. Altogether, these results suggest that GLP is an important enzyme with cyanide-decomposing and sulfurtransferase functions in bacteria, whose presence in eukaryotes we could not observe, representing a promising biological target for new pharmaceuticals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cueva de la Mora (CM) is an acidic, meromictic pit lake in the Iberian Pyrite Belt characterized by extremely high metal(loid) concentrations and strong gradients in oxygen, metal, and nutrient concentrations. We hypothesized that geochemical variations with depth would result in differences in community composition and in metal resistance strategies among active microbial populations. We also hypothesized that metal resistance gene (MRG) expression would correlate with toxicity levels for dissolved metal species in the lake. Water samples were collected in the upper oxic layer, chemocline, and deep anoxic layer of the lake for shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing. Metagenomic analyses revealed dramatic differences in the composition of the microbial communities with depth, consistent with changing geochemistry. Based on relative abundance of taxa identified in each metagenome, Eukaryotes (predominantly Coccomyxa) dominated the upper layer, while Archaea (predominantly Thermoplasmatales) dominated the deep layer, and a combination of Bacteria and Eukaryotes were abundant at the chemocline. We compared metal resistance across communities using a curated list of protein-coding MRGs with KEGG Orthology identifiers (KOs) and found that there were broad differences in the metal resistance strategies (e.g., intracellular metal accumulation) expressed by Eukaryotes, Bacteria, and Archaea. Although normalized abundances of MRG and MRG expression were generally higher in the deep layer, expression of metal-specific genes was not strongly related to variations in specific metal concentrations, especially for Cu and As. We also compared MRG potential and expression in metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from the deep layer, where metal concentrations are highest. Consistent with previous work showing differences in metal resistance mechanisms even at the strain level, MRG expression patterns varied strongly among MAG populations from the same depth. Some MAG populations expressed very few MRG known to date, suggesting that novel metal resistance strategies remain to be discovered in uncultivated acidophiles. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Here, we report three new Acidiphilium genomes, reclassified existing Acidiphilium species, and performed the first comparative genomic analysis on Acidiphilium in an attempt to address the metabolic potential, ecological functions, and evolutionary history of the genus Acidiphilium. In the genomes of Acidiphilium, we found an abundant repertoire of horizontally transferred genes (HTGs) contributing to environmental adaption and metabolic expansion, including genes conferring photosynthesis (puf, puh), CO2 assimilation (rbc), capacity for methane metabolism (mmo, mdh, frm), nitrogen source utilization (nar, cyn, hmp), sulfur compound utilization (sox, psr, sqr), and multiple metal and osmotic stress resistance capacities (czc, cop, ect). Additionally, the predicted donors of horizontal gene transfer were present in a cooccurrence network of Acidiphilium. Genome-scale positive selection analysis revealed that 15 genes contained adaptive mutations, most of which were multifunctional and played critical roles in the survival of extreme conditions. We proposed that Acidiphilium originated in mild conditions and adapted to extreme environments such as acidic mineral sites after the acquisition of many essential functions. IMPORTANCE Extremophiles, organisms that thrive in extreme environments, are key models for research on biological adaption. They can provide hints for the origin and evolution of life, as well as improve the understanding of biogeochemical cycling of elements. Extremely acidophilic bacteria such as Acidiphilium are widespread in acid mine drainage (AMD) systems, but the metabolic potential, ecological functions, and evolutionary history of this genus are still ambiguous. Here, we sequenced the genomes of three new Acidiphilium strains and performed comparative genomic analysis on this extremely acidophilic bacterial genus. We found in the genomes of Acidiphilium an abundant repertoire of horizontally transferred genes (HTGs) contributing to environmental adaption and metabolic ability expansion, as indicated by phylogenetic reconstruction and gene context comparison. This study has advanced our understanding of microbial evolution and biogeochemical cycling in extreme niches. Copyright © 2020 Li et al.

	abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD) is harmful to the environment and human health. Microorganisms-mineral interactions are responsible for AMD generation but can also remediate AMD contamination. Understanding the microbial response to AMD irrigation will reveal microbial survival strategies and provide approaches for AMD remediation. A terrace with sharp geochemical gradients caused by AMD flooding were selected to study the microbial response to changes in environmental parameters related to AMD contamination. AMD intrusion reduced soil microbial community diversity and further changed phylogenetic clustering patterns along the terrace gradient. We observed several genera seldom reported in AMD-related environments (i.e., Corynebacterium, Ochrobactrum, Natronomonas), suggesting flexible survival strategies such as nitrogen fixation, despite the poor nutritional environment. A co-occurrence network of heavily-contaminated fields was densely connected. The phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Euryarchaeota were all highly interconnected members, which may affect the formation of AMD. Detailed microbial response to different soil characterizations were highlighted by random forest model. Results revealed the top three parameters influencing the microbial diversity and interactions were pH, Fe(III), and sulfate. Various acidophilic Fe- and S-metabolizing bacteria were enriched in the lower fields, which were heavily contaminated by AMD, and more neutrophiles prevailed in the less-contaminated upper fields. Many indicator species in the lower fields were identified, including Desulfosporosinus, Thermogymnomonas, Corynebacterium, Shewanella, Acidiphilium, Ochrobactrum, Leptospirillum, and Allobaculum, representing acid-tolerant bacteria community in relevant environment. The detection of one known sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e., Desulfosporosinus) suggested that biotic sulfate reduction may occur in acidic samples, which offers multiple advantages to AMD contamination treatment. Collectively, results suggested that the geochemical gradients substantially altered the soil microbiota and enriched the relevant microorganisms adapted to the different conditions. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the effects of contamination on the soil microbiota and establish a basis for in situ AMD bioremediation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd; This work revealed the soil microbial community diversity and phylogenetic interactions in response to the terrace gradient irrigated by AMD irrigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Achromatium is large, hyperpolyploid and the only known heterozygous bacterium. Single cells contain approximately 300 different chromosomes with allelic diversity far exceeding that typically harbored by single bacteria genera. Surveying all publicly available sediment sequence archives, we show that Achromatium is common worldwide, spanning temperature, salinity, pH, and depth ranges normally resulting in bacterial speciation. Although saline and freshwater Achromatium spp. appear phylogenetically separated, the genus Achromatium contains a globally identical, complete functional inventory regardless of habitat. Achromatium spp. cells from differing ecosystems (e.g., from freshwater to saline) are, unexpectedly, equally functionally equipped but differ in gene expression patterns by transcribing only relevant genes. We suggest that environmental adaptation occurs by increasing the copy number of relevant genes across the cell's hundreds of chromosomes, without losing irrelevant ones, thus maintaining the ability to survive in any ecosystem type. The functional versatility of Achromatium and its genomic features reveal alternative genetic and evolutionary mechanisms, expanding our understanding of the role and evolution of polyploidy in bacteria while challenging the bacterial species concept and drivers of bacterial speciation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {The resistance of microorganisms to heavy metals in polluted environments is mediated by genetically determined mechanisms. One such mechanism includes the intracellular sequestration of heavy metals in polyphosphate (polyP) inclusions. In Cr(III) contaminated mediums, Ochrobactrum anthropi DE2010 is able to bind and sequester Cr(III) in polyP inclusions. In order to further study the relationship between Cr(III) tolerance and polyP production in O. anthropi DE2010, we carried out whole genomic sequencing, analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), polyP chemical quantification, and determination of the relative abundance and morphometry of polyP inclusions. In the O. anthropi DE2010 genome, six polyP and pyrophosphate (PPi) metabolic genes were found. Furthermore, genomic analysis via SNPs calling revealed that O. anthropi ATCC49188 and DE2010 strains had average variations of 1.51% in their whole genome sequences and 1.35% variation associated with the principal polyP metabolic gene cluster. In addition, the accumulation of polyP in the DE2010 strain and number of polyP inclusions found were directly correlated with the concentration of Cr(III) in contaminated cultures. The results presented in this study may enhance the understanding of polyP production in response to Cr(III) toxicity in the O. anthropi DE2010 strain. This knowledge may facilitate the successful removal of Cr(III) from the natural environment. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and copper (Cu) are among the major historical and contemporary metal pollutants linked to global anthropogenic activities. Enterococcus have been considered indicators of fecal pollution and antibiotic resistance for years, but its largely underexplored metallome precludes understanding their role as metal pollution bioindicators as well. Our goal was to determine the occurrence, diversity, and phenotypes associated with known acquired genes/operons conferring tolerance to As, Hg or Cu among Enterococcus and to identify their genetic context (381 field isolates from diverse epidemiological and genetic backgrounds; 3547 enterococcal genomes available in databases representing a time span during 1900–2019). Genes conferring tolerance to As (arsA), Hg (merA) or Cu (tcrB) were used as biomarkers of widespread metal tolerance operons. Different variants of metal tolerance (MeT) genes (13 arsA, 6 merA, 1 tcrB) were more commonly recovered from the food-chain (arsA, tcrB) or humans (merA), and were shared with 49 other bacterial taxa. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that MeT genes occurred in heterogeneous operons, at least since the 1900s, with an increasing accretion of antibiotic resistance genes since the 1960's, reflecting diverse antimicrobial pollution. Multiple MeT genes were co-located on the chromosome or conjugative plasmids flanked by elements with high potential for recombination, often along with antibiotic resistance genes. Phenotypic analysis of some isolates carrying MeT genes revealed up to 128× fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentrations to metals. The main distribution of functional MeT genes among Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis from different sources, time spans, and clonal lineages, and their ability to acquire diverse genes from multiple taxa bacterial communities places these species as good candidates to be used as model organisms in future projects aiming at the identification and quantification of bioindicators of metal polluted environments by anthropogenic activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Agricultural land consolidation has been implemented to address land fragmentation problems in many countries. Land consolidation has substantial impacts on agroecosystems. However, studies of its effects on soil microbial communities are currently insufficient. We have designed this study to determine the effects of land consolidation on microbiota by comparing farmlands that had undergone land consolidation with nonconsolidated farmlands within one county in southeastern China. Land consolidation promoted bacterial alpha diversity and migration. Fungal communities were more stable than bacterial communities. The beta diversity analysis showed that bacteria and fungi were both significantly impacted by land consolidation. Some bacterial and fungal genera were analysed to evaluate the soil ecosystem functions. The abundances of the bacterial genera Catenulispora, Symbiobacterium, Pelotomaculum, and Cytophaga and of the fungal genera Microscypha, Phialocephala, and Hypholoma were significantly higher under land consolidation than without land consolidation. The results of microbial community analysis and functional prediction indicated that land consolidation significantly improved hydrocarbon degradation. Land consolidation may also promote the abundance of genera associated with nitrogen through the implementation of reasonable management practices. In summary, land consolidation can result in better agricultural management and unified planting pattern that promote bacterial diversity and decrease spatial heterogeneity, because of the supervision system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities inhabiting extreme environments such as Salar de Huasco (SH) in northern Chile are adapted to thrive while exposed to several abiotic pressures and the presence of toxic elements such as arsenic (As). Hence, we aimed to uncover the role of As in shaping bacterial composition, structure, and functional potential in five different sites in this altiplanic wetland using a shotgun metagenomic approach. The sites exhibit wide gradients of As (9 to 321 mg/kg), and our results showed highly diverse communities and a clear dominance exerted by the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla. Functional potential analyses show broadly convergent patterns, contrasting with their great taxonomic variability. As-related metabolism, as well as other functional categories such as those related to the CH4 and S cycles, differs among the five communities. Particularly, we found that the distribution and abundance of As-related genes increase as the As concentration rises. Approximately 75% of the detected genes for As metabolism belong to expulsion mechanisms; arsJ and arsP pumps are related to sites with higher As concentrations and are present almost exclusively in Proteobacteria. Furthermore, taxonomic diversity and functional potential are reflected in the 12 reconstructed high-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to the Bacteroidetes (5), Proteobacteria (5), Cyanobacteria (1), and Gemmatimonadetes (1) phyla. We conclude that SH microbial communities are diverse and possess a broad genetic repertoire to thrive under extreme conditions, including increasing concentrations of highly toxic As. Finally, this environment represents a reservoir of unknown and undescribed microorganisms, with great metabolic versatility, which needs further study. IMPORTANCE As microbial communities inhabiting extreme environments are fundamental for maintaining ecosystems, many studies concerning composition, functionality, and interactions have been carried out. However, much is still unknown. Here, we sampled microbial communities in the Salar de Huasco, an extreme environment subjected to several abiotic stresses (high UV radiation, salinity and arsenic; low pressure and temperatures). We found that although microbes are taxonomically diverse, functional potential seems to have an important degree of convergence, suggesting high levels of adaptation. Particularly, arsenic metabolism showed differences associated with increasing concentrations of the metalloid throughout the area, and it effectively exerts a significant pressure over these organisms. Thus, the significance of this research is that we describe highly specialized communities thriving in little-explored environments subjected to several pressures, considered analogous of early Earth and other planets, that have the potential for unraveling technologies to face the repercussions of climate change in many areas of interest. © 2021.

	abstract = {Bupivacaine has been widely used in clinical Anesthesia, but its neurotoxicity has been frequently reported, implicating cellular oxidative DNA damage as the major underlying mechanism. However, the mechanism underlying bupivacaine-induced oxidative DNA damage is unknown. We, thus, exposed SH-SY5Y cells to 1.5mM bupivacaine to induce neurotoxicity. Then, iTRAQ proteomic analysis was used to explore the repair of neuronal oxidative DNA damage. By analyzing the STRING version 11.0 database, the bioinformatics relationship between key repair enzymes was tracked. Subsequently, immunofluorescence co-localization and immunoprecipitation were used to investigate the interaction between key repair enzymes. The iTRAQ showed that Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) from the base excision repair pathway participated closely in the repair of oxidative DNA damage induced by bupivacaine, and inhibition of PARP-1 expression significantly aggravated bupivacaine-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Interestingly, this study showed that there were interactions and co-expression between PARP-1 and XPD (xeroderma pigmentosum D), another key protein of the nucleic acid excision repair pathway. After inhibiting XPD, PARP-1 expression was significantly reduced. However, simultaneous inhibition of both XPD and PARP-1 did not further increase DNA damage. It is concluded that PARP-1 may repair bupivacaine-induced oxidative DNA damage through XPD-mediated interactions. © 2021 Zhao et al.

	abstract = {Background: Recent studies have significantly expanded our knowledge of viral diversity and functions in the environment. Exploring the ecological relationships between viruses, hosts, and the environment is a crucial first step towards a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic interplays among them. Results: Here, we obtained extensive 16S rRNA gene amplicon, metagenomics sequencing, and geochemical datasets from different depths of two highly stratified sulfidic mine tailings cores with steep geochemical gradients especially pH, and explored how variations in viral community composition and functions were coupled to the co-existing prokaryotic assemblages and the varying environmental conditions. Our data showed that many viruses in the mine tailings represented novel genera, based on gene-sharing networks. Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Myoviridae dominated the classified viruses in the surface tailings and deeper layers. Both viral richness and normalized coverage increased with depth in the tailings cores and were significantly correlated with geochemical properties, for example, pH. Viral richness was also coupled to prokaryotic richness (Pearson's r = 0.65, P = 0.032). The enrichment of prophages in the surface mine tailings suggested a preference of lysogenic viral lifestyle in more acidic conditions. Community-wide comparative analyses clearly showed that viruses in the surface tailings encoded genes mostly with unknown functions while viruses in the deeper layers contained genes mainly annotated as conventional functions related to metabolism and structure. Notably, significantly abundant assimilatory sulfate reduction genes were identified from the deeper tailings layers and they were widespread in viruses predicted to infect diverse bacterial phyla. Conclusions: Overall, our results revealed a depth-related distribution of viral populations in the extreme and heterogeneous tailings system. The viruses may interact with diverse hosts and dynamic environmental conditions and likely play a role in the functioning of microbial community and modulate sulfur cycles in situ.

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferridurans JAGS is a newly isolated acidophile from an acid mine drainage (AMD). The genome of isolate JAGS was sequenced and compared with eight other published genomes of Acidithiobacillus. The pairwise mutation distance (Mash) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) revealed that isolate JAGS had a close evolutionary relationship with A. ferridurans JCM18981, but whole-genome alignment showed that it had higher similarity in genomic structure with A. ferrooxidans species. Pan-genome analysis revealed that nine genomes were comprised of 4601 protein coding sequences, of which 43% were core genes (1982) and 23% were unique genes (1064). A. ferridurans species had more unique genes (205–246) than A. ferrooxidans species (21–234). Functional gene categorizations showed that A. ferridurans strains had a higher portion of genes involved in energy production and conversion while A. ferrooxidans had more for inorganic ion transport and metabolism. A high abundance of kdp, mer and ars genes, as well as mobile genetic elements, was found in isolate JAGS, which might contribute to its resistance to harsh environments. These find-ings expand our understanding of the evolutionary adaptation of Acidithiobacillus and indicate that A. ferridurans JAGS is a promising candidate for biomining and AMD biotreatment applications. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Vanadium (V) is an important metal with critical industrial and medical applications. Elevated V contamination, however, can be a threat to the environment and human health. Microorganisms can reduce the more toxic and mobile VV to the less toxic and immobile VIV, which could be a detoxification and energy metabolism strategy adopted by V-reducing bacteria (VRB). The limited understanding of microbial responses to V contamination and the mechanisms for VV reduction, however, hamper our capability to attenuate V contamination. This study focused on determining the microbial responses to elevated V concentration and the mechanisms of VV reduction in V tailings. The bacterial communities were characterized and compared between the V tailings and the less contaminated adjacent mineral soils. Further, VV-reducing enrichments indicated that bacteria associated with Polaromonas, a genus belonging to the family Burkholderiaceae, were potentially responsible for VV reduction. Retrieved metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) suggested that the Polaromonas spp. encoded genes (cymA, omcA, and narG) were responsible for VV reduction. Additionally, Polaromonas spp. was metabolically versatile and could use both organic and inorganic electron donors. The metabolic versatility of Polaromonas spp. may be important for its ability to flourish in the V tailings.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Type IV CRISPR-Cas are a distinct variety of highly derived CRISPR-Cas systems that appear to have evolved from type III systems through the loss of the target-cleaving nuclease and partial deterioration of the large subunit of the effector complex. All known type IV CRISPR-Cas systems are encoded on plasmids, integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), or prophages, and are thought to contribute to competition between these elements, although the mechanistic details of their function remain unknown. There is a clear parallel between the compositions and likely origin of type IV and type I systems recruited by Tn7-like transposons and mediating RNA-guided transposition. We investigated the diversity and evolutionary relationships of type IV systems, with a focus on those in Acidithiobacillia, where this variety of CRISPR is particularly abundant and always found on ICEs. Our analysis revealed remarkable evolutionary plasticity of type IV CRISPR-Cas systems, with adaptation and ancillary genes originating from different ancestral CRISPR-Cas varieties, and extensive gene shuffling within the type IV loci. The adaptation module and the CRISPR array apparently were lost in the type IV ancestor but were subsequently recaptured by type IV systems on several independent occasions. We demonstrate a high level of heterogeneity among the repeats with type IV CRISPR arrays, which far exceed the heterogeneity of any other known CRISPR repeats and suggest a unique adaptation mechanism. The spacers in the type IV arrays, for which protospacers could be identified, match plasmid genes, in particular those encoding the conjugation apparatus components. Both the biochemical mechanism of type IV CRISPR-Cas function and their role in the competition among mobile genetic elements remain to be investigated. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

	abstract = {We describe the geochemistry and microbial diversity of a pristine environment that resembles an acid rock drainage (ARD) but it is actually the result of hydrothermal and volcanic influences. We designate this environment, and other comparable sites, as volcanic influenced acid rock drainage (VARD) systems. The metal content and sulfuric acid in this ecosystem stem from the volcanic milieu and not from the product of pyrite oxidation. Based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we report the microbial community structure in the pristine San Cayetano Costa Rican VARD environment (pH = 2.94–3.06, sulfate ~ 0.87–1.19 g L−1, iron ~ 35–61 mg L−1 (waters), and ~ 8–293 g kg−1 (sediments)). San Cayetano was found to be dominated by microorganisms involved in the geochemical cycling of iron, sulfur, and nitrogen; however, the identity and abundance of the species changed with the oxygen content (0.40–6.06 mg L−1) along the river course. The hypoxic source of San Cayetano is dominated by a putative anaerobic sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacterium. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus or Sulfobacillus are found in smaller proportions with respect to typical ARD. In the oxic downstream, we identified aerobic iron-oxidizers (Leptospirillum, Acidithrix, Ferrovum) and heterotrophic bacteria (Burkholderiaceae bacterium, Trichococcus, Acidocella). Thermoplasmatales archaea closely related to environmental phylotypes found in other ARD niches were also observed throughout the entire ecosystem. Overall, our study shows the differences and similarities in the diversity and distribution of the microbial communities between an ARD and a VARD system at the source and along the oxygen gradient that establishes on the course of the river. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The “dark transcriptome” can be considered the multitude of sequences that are transcribed but not annotated as genes. We evaluated expression of 6,692 annotated genes and 29,354 unannotated open reading frames (ORFs) in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome across diverse environmental, genetic and developmental conditions (3,457 RNA-Seq samples). Over 30% of the highly transcribed ORFs have translation evidence. Phylostratigraphic analysis infers most of these transcribed ORFs would encode species-specific proteins (“orphan-ORFs”); hundreds have mean expression comparable to annotated genes. These data reveal unannotated ORFs most likely to be protein-coding genes. We partitioned a co-expression matrix by Markov Chain Clustering; the resultant clusters contain 2,468 orphan-ORFs. We provide the aggregated RNA-Seq yeast data with extensive metadata as a project in MetaOmGraph (MOG), a tool designed for interactive analysis and visualization. This approach enables reuse of public RNA-Seq data for exploratory discovery, providing a rich context for experimentalists to make novel, experimentally testable hypotheses about candidate genes. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Singh, Arendsee and Wurtele.},

	abstract = {Members of the bacterial candidate phylum WPS-2 (or Eremiobacterota) are abundant in several dry, bare soil environments. In a bare soil deposited by an extinct iron–sulfur spring, we found that WPS-2 comprised up to 24% of the bacterial community and up to 108 cells per g of soil based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantification. A single genus-level cluster (Ca. Rubrimentiphilum) predominated in bare soils but was less abundant in adjacent forest. Nearly complete genomes of Ca. Rubrimentiphilum were recovered as single amplified genomes (SAGs) and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Surprisingly, given the abundance of WPS-2 in bare soils, the genomes did not indicate any capacity for autotrophy, phototrophy, or trace gas metabolism. Instead, they suggest a predominantly aerobic organoheterotrophic lifestyle, perhaps based on scavenging amino acids, nucleotides, and complex oligopeptides, along with lithotrophic capacity on thiosulfate. Network analyses of the entire community showed that some species of Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and candidate phylum AD3 (or Dormibacterota) co-occurred with Ca. Rubrimentiphilum and may represent ecological or metabolic partners. We propose that Ca. Rubrimentiphilum act as efficient heterotrophic scavengers. Combined with previous studies, these data suggest that the phylum WPS-2 includes bacteria with diverse metabolic capabilities. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Systems modelled in the context of molecular and cellular biology are difficult to represent with a single calibrated numerical model. Flux optimisation hypotheses have shown tremendous promise to accurately predict bacterial metabolism but they require a precise understanding of metabolic reactions occurring in the considered species. Unfortunately, this information may not be available for more complex organisms or non-cultured microorganisms such as those evidenced in microbiomes with metagenomic techniques. In both cases, flux optimisation techniques may not be applicable to elucidate systems functioning. In this context, we describe how automatic reasoning allows relevant features of an unconventional biological system to be identified despite a lack of data. A particular focus is put on the use of Answer Set Programming, a logic programming paradigm with combinatorial optimisation functionalities. We describe its usage to over-approximate metabolic responses of biological systems and solve gap-filling problems. In this review, we compare steady-states and Boolean abstractions of metabolic models and illustrate their complementarity via applications to the metabolic analysis of macro-algae. Ongoing applications of this formalism explore the emerging field of systems ecology, notably elucidating interactions between a consortium of microbes and a host organism. As the first step in this field, we will illustrate how the reduction in microbiotas according to expected metabolic phenotypes can be addressed with gap-filling problems. © 2020 Portland Press Ltd.

	abstract = {Microorganisms used for the biohydrometallurgical extraction of metals from minerals must be able to survive high levels of metal and oxidative stress found in bioleaching environments. The Acidihalobacter genus consists of four species of halotolerant, iron–sulfur-oxidizing acidophiles that are unique in their ability to tolerate chloride and acid stress while simultaneously bioleaching minerals. This paper uses bioinformatic tools to predict the genes and mechanisms used by Acidihalobacter members in their defense against a wide range of metals and oxidative stress. Analysis revealed the presence of multiple conserved mechanisms of metal tolerance. Ac. yilgarnensis F5T, the only member of this genus that oxidizes the mineral chalcopyrite, contained a 39.9 Kb gene cluster consisting of 40 genes encoding mobile elements and an array of proteins with direct functions in copper resistance. The analysis also revealed multiple strategies that the Acidihalobacter members can use to tolerate high levels of oxidative stress. Three of the Acidihalobacter genomes were found to contain genes encoding catalases, which are not common to acidophilic microorganisms. Of particular interest was a rubrerythrin genomic cluster containing genes that have a polyphyletic origin of stress-related functions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The genome of Acidiphilium multivorum strain AIU 301, acidophilic, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, was investigated for potential metabolic pathways associated with organic acid production and metal uptake. The genome was compared to other acidic mine drainage isolates, Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5 and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270, as well as Acetobacter pasteurianus 386B, which ferments cocoa beans. Plasmids between two Acidiphilium spp. were compared, and only two of the sixteen plasmids were identified as potentially similar. Comparisons of the genome size to the number of protein coding sequences indicated that A. multivorum and A. cryptum follow the line of best fit unlike A. pasteurianus 386B, which suggests that it was improperly annotated in the database. Pathways between these four species were analyzed bioinformatically and are discussed here. A. multivorum AIU 301, shares pathways with A. pasteurianus 386B including aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase pathways, which are used in the generation of vinegar. Mercury reductase, arsenate reductase and sulfur utilization proteins were identified and discussed at length. The absence of sulfur utilization proteins from A. multivorum AIU 301 suggests that this species uses previously undefined pathways for sulfur acquisition.

	abstract = {Aquatic environments with high levels of dissolved ferrous iron and low levels of sulfate serve as an important systems for exploring biogeochemical processes relevant to the early Earth. Boreal Shield lakes, which number in the tens of millions globally, commonly develop seasonally anoxic waters that become iron rich and sulfate poor, yet the iron–sulfur microbiology of these systems has been poorly examined. Here we use genome-resolved metagenomics and enrichment cultivation to explore the metabolic diversity and ecology of anoxygenic photosynthesis and iron/sulfur cycling in the anoxic water columns of three Boreal Shield lakes. We recovered four high-completeness and low-contamination draft genome bins assigned to the class Chlorobia (formerly phylum Chlorobi) from environmental metagenome data and enriched two novel sulfide-oxidizing species, also from the Chlorobia. The sequenced genomes of both enriched species, including the novel “Candidatus Chlorobium canadense”, encoded the cyc2 gene that is associated with photoferrotrophy among cultured Chlorobia members, along with genes for phototrophic sulfide oxidation. One environmental genome bin also encoded cyc2. Despite the presence of cyc2 in the corresponding draft genome, we were unable to induce photoferrotrophy in “Ca. Chlorobium canadense”. Genomic potential for phototrophic sulfide oxidation was more commonly detected than cyc2 among environmental genome bins of Chlorobia, and metagenome and cultivation data suggested the potential for cryptic sulfur cycling to fuel sulfide-based growth. Overall, our results provide an important basis for further probing the functional role of cyc2 and indicate that anoxygenic photoautotrophs in Boreal Shield lakes could have underexplored photophysiology pertinent to understanding Earth’s early microbial communities. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

	abstract = {It has only recently been discovered that naturally prevailing microorganisms have a notable role in flotation in addition to chemical process parameters and overall water quality. This study’s aim was to assess the prevailing microbial communities in relation to process chemistry in a zinc and copper mineral flotation plant. Due to the limitations of cultivation-based microbial methods that detect only a fraction of the total microbial diversity, DNA-based methods were utilised. However, it was discovered that the DNA extraction methods need to be improved for these environments with high mineral particle content. Microbial communities and metabolism were studied with quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing of bacterial, archaeal and fungal marker genes and shotgun sequencing. Bacteria dominated the microbial communities, but in addition, both archaea and fungi were present. The predominant bacterial metabolism included versatile sulfur compound oxidation. Putative Thiovirga sp. dominated in the zinc plant and the water circuit samples, whereas Thiobacillus spp. dominated the copper plant. Halothiobacillus spp. were also an apparent part of the community in all samples. Nitrogen metabolism was more related to assimilatory than dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite oxidation/reduction reactions. Abundance of heavy metal resistance genes emphasized the adaptation and competitive edge of the core microbiome in these extreme conditions compared to microorganisms freshly entering the process. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Understanding the structure of microbial communities in acidic, metal contaminated tailings and waste rock in cool, continental northern temperate climates is important for identifying their potential for use in phytostabilization and bioremediation programs. In this study, microbial community compositions across two large mine waste sites in the Sudbury basin, Ontario Canada were analyzed along gradients of barren-to-vegetated tailings and waste rock. Microbial communities were less diverse, more homogenous, and mainly chemolithoautotrophic in barren sites, transitioning to more diverse communities of organoheterotrophs, nitrogen-fixing/plant-growth promoting bacteria, and ectomycorrhizal fungi in the vegetated areas. Co-occurrence analyses of microbial communities demonstrated higher levels of association among microbial groups in the barren tailings, which were related to the extreme environmental and chemical conditions and restricted anabolic nutrient availability of the substrates. We also show that vegetation and plant-derived organic matter in the tailings are associated with the shifts observed in the structure of microbial communities towards more soil-like communities. These changes in microbial communities can improve soil fertility through increased rates of heterotrophic decomposition of plant-derived organic matter, and sequentially further aid in the establishment of vegetation. These findings will help develop phytostabilization approaches in mine tailings and waste rock in cool, continental northern temperate and boreal climates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Zero-valent sulfur (ZVS) has been shown to be a major sulfur intermediate in the deep-sea cold seep of the South China Sea based on our previous work, however, the microbial contribution to the formation of ZVS in cold seep has remained unclear. Here, we describe a novel thiosulfate oxidation pathway discovered in the deep-sea cold seep bacterium Erythrobacter flavus 21–3, which provides a new clue about the formation of ZVS. Electronic microscopy, energy-dispersive, and Raman spectra were used to confirm that E. flavus 21–3 effectively converts thiosulfate to ZVS. We next used a combined proteomic and genetic method to identify thiosulfate dehydrogenase (TsdA) and thiosulfohydrolase (SoxB) playing key roles in the conversion of thiosulfate to ZVS. Stoichiometric results of different sulfur intermediates further clarify the function of TsdA in converting thiosulfate to tetrathionate (−O3S–S–S–SO3−), SoxB in liberating sulfone from tetrathionate to form ZVS and sulfur dioxygenases (SdoA/SdoB) in oxidizing ZVS to sulfite under some conditions. Notably, homologs of TsdA, SoxB, and SdoA/SdoB widely exist across the bacteria including in Erythrobacter species derived from different environments. This strongly indicates that this novel thiosulfate oxidation pathway might be frequently used by microbes and plays an important role in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle in nature. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As compared to eukaryotes, bacteria have a reduced tRNA gene set encoding between 30 and 220 tRNAs. Although in most bacterial phyla tRNA genes are dispersed in the genome, many species from distinct phyla also show genes forming arrays. Here, we show that two types of arrays with distinct evolutionary origins exist. This work focuses on long tRNA gene arrays (L-arrays) that encompass up to 43 genes, which disseminate by horizontal gene transfer and contribute supernumerary tRNA genes to the host. Although in the few cases previously studied these arrays were reported to be poorly transcribed, here we show that the L-array of the model cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, encoding 23 functional tRNAs, is largely induced upon impairment of the translation machinery. The cellular response to this challenge involves a global reprogramming of the transcriptome in two phases. tRNAs encoded in the array are induced in the second phase of the response, directly contributing to cell survival. Results presented here show that in some bacteria the tRNA gene set may be partitioned between a housekeeping subset, which constantly sustains translation, and an inducible subset that is generally silent but can provide functionality under particular conditions. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans is a psychrotolerant acidophile capable of growing and oxidizing ferrous and sulphide substrates at low temperatures. To date, six genomes of this organism have been characterized; however, evidence of a plasmid in this species has been reported only once, whereby there is no conclusive role of the plasmids in the species. Herein, two novel plasmids of A. ferrivorans PQ33 were molecularly characterized and compared at a genomic scale. The genomes of two plasmids (12 kbp and 10 kbp) from A. ferrivorans PQ33 (NZ_LVZL01000000) were sequenced and annotated. The plasmids, named pAfPQ33-1 (NZ_CP021414.1) and pAfPQ33-2 (NZ_CP021415.1), presented 9 CDS and 13 CDS, respectively. In silico analysis showed proteins involved in conjugation (TraD, MobA, Eep and XerD), toxin-antitoxin systems (HicA and HicB), replication (RepA and DNA binding protein), transcription regulation (CopG), chaperone DnaJ, and a virulence gene (vapD). Furthermore, the plasmids contain sequences similar to phosphate-selective porins O and P and a diguanylate cyclase-phosphodiesterase protein. The presence of these genes suggests the possibility of horizontal transfer, a regulatory system of plasmid maintenance, and adhesion to substrates for A. ferrivorans species and PQ33. This is the first report of plasmids in this strain. © 2021 Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Af) is an acidophilic bacterium that grows in rigid surroundings and gets its own energy from the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. These bacteria are involved in the bioleaching process. Cyc1 is a periplasmic protein with a crucial role in electron transportation in the respiratory chain. His53 of the Cyc1 protein, involved in electron transfer to CoxB, was selected for mutation and bioinformatics studies. His53 was substituted by Ile using PyMol software. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for wild and mutant types of Cyc1 protein. The conformational changes of mutated protein were studied by analyzing RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, H Bond, and DSSP. The results of the RMSF analysis indicated an increase in the flexibility of the ligand in the mutant. Finally, active site instability leads to an increase in the value of E0 at the mutation point and improving electron transfer. On the other, His53 in Cyc1 is interconnected to Glu126 in CoxB through the water molecule (W76) and hydrogen bonding. In the H53I mutation, there was a decrease in the distance between H2O 2030, 2033, and isoleucine 53, and subsequently, the distance to the water molecule 76 between the two proteins was reduced and strengthens the hydrogen bond between Cyc1 and CoxB, finally improves electron transfer and the bioleaching process. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The poor carboxylation properties of plant rubiscos have led to efforts that made it the most kinetically characterized enzyme, yet these studies focused on ' 5% of its natural diversity. Here, we searched for fast-carboxylating variants by systematically mining genomic and metagenomic data. Approximately 33,000 unique rubisco sequences were identified and clustered into ≈ 1,000 similarity groups. We then synthesized, purified, and biochemically tested the carboxylation rates of 143 representatives, spanning all clusters of form-II and form-II/III rubiscos. Most variants (' 100) were active in vitro, with the fastest having a turnover number of 22 ± 1 s−1—sixfold faster than the median plant rubisco and nearly twofold faster than the fastest measured rubisco to date. Unlike rubiscos from plants and cyanobacteria, the fastest variants discovered here are homodimers and exhibit a much simpler folding and activation kinetics.

	abstract = {Involvements of quorum sensing (QS) in the formation of aerobic granules for wastewater treatment have been well recognized. In previous studies the evolution of the QS-related activities and communities during bioreactor start-up period has been extensively studied, while the variation of QS in long-term reactor operation remains unrevealed. Furthermore, information about the roles of quorum quenching (QQ) in bioreactors is very limited. In this work, both QS and QQ during the start-up and successive long-term operation period of an aerobic granule bioreactor were explored. The QS activity and communities increased in the start-up but gradually decreased in the long-term operation, while the QQ activity and communities remained stable. These results indicate the longer persistence of QQ than QS in the granules and the minor contribution of QS in the long-term operation. This work provides a new insight into the roles of QQ and QS in wastewater treatment bioreactors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nutrient deficiency, especially bio-available nitrogen deficiency, often impedes the bioremediation efforts of mining generated tailings. Biological nitrogen fixation is a critical process necessary for the initial nitrogen buildup in tailings. Current knowledge regarding the diazotrophs that inhabit tailings is still in its infancy. Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive investigation combining geochemical characterization, sequence analyses, molecular techniques, and activity measurements was conducted to characterize the diazotrophic community residing in tailing environments. Significant differences between tailings and their adjacent soils in prokaryotic and diazotrophic communities were detected. Meanwhile, strong and significant correlations between the absolute abundance of the nitrogen fixation (nifH), carbon fixation (cbbL), sulfur oxidation (soxB), and arsenite oxidation (aioA) genes were observed in the tailings but not in the soils. The reconstructed nif-containing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) suggest that the carbon fixation and sulfur oxidation pathways were important for potential diazotrophs inhabiting the tailings. Activity measurements further confirmed that diazotrophs inhabiting tailings preferentially use inorganic electron donors (e.g., elemental sulfur) compared to organic electron donors (e.g., sucrose), while diazotrophs inhabiting soils preferred organic carbon sources. Collectively, these findings suggest that chemolithoautotrophic diazotrophs may play essential roles in acquiring nutrients and facilitating ecological succession in tailings. © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Palmitic acid (PA) in root exudates or decaying residues can reduce the incidence of soil-borne diseases and promote the growth of some crop plants. However, the effects of PA on soil-borne pathogens and microbial communities are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of PA on overall watermelon microbial communities and the populations of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. niveum (Fon). The effects of PA on the mycelial growth and spore production of Fon were tested in vitro, while its effects on Fon, total bacteria and total fungi populations, and microbial communities were evaluated in a pot experiment. The results revealed that all test concentrations of PA inhibited Fon mycelia growth and spore production. The pot experiment showed that 0.5 mM and 1 mM PA reduced Fon but increased total bacteria populations, and 0.5 mM and 1 mM PA 0.5 mM and 1 mM PA promoted the change to a soil type of bacteria soil. Meanwhile, 0.5 mM PA and 1 mM PA altered the community composition of the rhizosphere microorganisms and reduced the relative abundance of two bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the two fungal OTUs that were significantly (p < 0.01) related with disease severity and increased that of four bacterial OTUs and the two fungal that were highly significantly (p < 0.01) negatively correlated with the disease severity. These results suggest that application of PA decreased the populations of Fon, changed the rhizosphere microbial composition, reduced the disease severity of Fusarium wilt, and promoted the growth of watermelon. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {An anaerobic bacterial strain, designated MA18T, was isolated from a laboratory-scale biogas fermenter fed with maize silage. Cells stained Gram-negative and performed Gram-negative in the KOH test. The peptidoglycan type was found to be A1y-meso-Dpm direct. The major cellular fatty acids were C14:0 iso, C15:0 iso, anteiso and iso DMA as well as a C16 unidentified fatty acid. Oxidase and catalase activities were absent. Cells were slightly curved rods, motile, formed spores and measured approximately 0.35 µm in diameter and 3.0–5.0 µm in length. When cultivated on GS2 agar with cellobiose, round, arched, shiny and slightly yellow-pigmented colonies were formed. The isolate was mesophilic to moderately thermophilic with a growth optimum between 40 and 48 °C. Furthermore, neutral pH values were preferred and up to 1.2% (w/v) NaCl supplemented to the GS2 medium was tolerated. Producing mainly acetate and ethanol, MA18T fermented arabinose, cellobiose, crystalline and amorphous cellulose, ribose, and xylan. The genome of MA18T consists of 4817678 bp with a G+C content of 33.16 mol%. In the annotated protein sequences, cellulosomal components were detected. Phylogenetically, MA18T is most closely related to Ruminiclostridium sufflavum DSM 19573T (76.88% average nucleotide identity of the whole genome sequence; 97.23% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and can be clustered into one clade with other species of the genus Ruminiclostridium, family Oscillospiraceae, class Clostridia. Based on morphological, physiological and genetic characteristics, this strain represents a novel species in the genus Ruminiclostridium. Therefore, the name Ruminiclostridium herbifermentans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MA18T (=DSM 109966T=JCM 39124T). © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {In this study, we performed a year-long in situ incubation experiment on a common ferrous sulfide (Fe-S) mineral, pyrite, at the oxidative deep seafloor in the hydrothermal vent field in the Izu-Bonin arc, Japan, and characterized its microbiological and biogeochemical properties to understand the microbial alteration processes of the pyrite, focusing on Fe(II) oxidation. The microbial community analysis of the incubated pyrite showed that the domain Bacteria heavily dominated over Archaea compared with that of the ambient seawater, and Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria distinctively codominated at the class level. The mineralogical characterization by surface-sensitive Fe X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis revealed that specific Fe(III) hydroxides (schwertmannite and ferrihydrite) were locally formed at the pyrite surface as the pyrite alteration products. Based on the Fe(III) hydroxide species and proportion, we thermodynamically calculated the pH value at the pyrite surface to be pH 4.9 to 5.7, indicating that the acidic condition derived from pyrite alteration was locally formed at the surface against neutral ambient seawater. This acidic microenvironment at the pyrite surface might explain the distinct microbial communities found in our pyrite samples. Also, the acidity at the pyrite surface indicates that the abiotic Fe(II) oxidation rate was much limited at the pyrite surface kinetically, 3.9 X 103- to 1.6 X 105-fold lower than that in the ambient seawater. Moreover, nanoscale characterization of microbial biomolecules using carbon near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) analysis showed that the sessile cells attached to pyrite excreted the acidic polysaccharide-rich extracellular polymeric substances at the pyrite surface, which can lead to the promotion of biogenic Fe(II) oxidation and pyrite alteration. IMPORTANCE Pyrite is one of the most common Fe-S minerals found in submarine hydrothermal environments. Previous studies demonstrated that the Fe-S mineral can be a suitable host for Fe(II)-oxidizing microbes in hydrothermal environments; however, the details of microbial Fe(II) oxidation processes with Fe-S mineral alteration are not well known. The spectroscopic and thermodynamic examination in the present study suggests that a moderately acidic pH condition was locally formed at the pyrite surface during pyrite alteration at the seafloor due to proton releases with Fe(II) and sulfidic S oxidations. Following previous studies, the abiotic Fe(II) oxidation rate significantly decreases with a decrease in pH, but the biotic (microbial) Fe(II) oxidation rate is not sensitive to the pH decrease. Thus, our findings clearly suggest that the pyrite surface is a unique microenvironment where abiotic Fe(II) oxidation is limited and biotic Fe(II) oxidation is more prominent than that in neutral ambient seawater.

	abstract = {Natural attenuation of heavy metals occurs via coupled microbial iron cycling and metal precipitation in creeks impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD). Here, we describe the isolation, characterization, and genomic sequencing of two iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) species: Thiomonas ferrovorans FB-6 and Thiomonas metallidurans FB-Cd, isolated from slightly acidic (pH 6.3), Fe-rich, AMD-impacted creek sediments. These strains precipitated amorphous iron oxides, lepidocrocite, goethite, and magnetite or maghemite and grew at a pH optimum of 5.5. While Thiomonas spp. are known as mixotrophic sulfur oxidizers and As oxidizers, the FB strains oxidized Fe, which suggests they can efficiently remove Fe and other metals via coprecipitation. Previous evidence for Thiomonas sp. Fe oxidation is largely ambiguous, possibly because of difficulty demonstrating Fe oxidation in heterotrophic/mixotrophic organisms. Therefore, we also conducted a genomic analysis to identify genetic mechanisms of Fe oxidation, other metal transformations, and additional adaptations, comparing the two FB strain genomes with 12 other Thiomonas genomes. The FB strains fall within a relatively novel group of Thiomonas strains that includes another strain (b6) with solid evidence of Fe oxidation. Most Thiomonas isolates, including the FB strains, have the putative iron oxidation gene cyc2, but only the two FB strains possess the putative Fe oxidase genes mtoAB. The two FB strain genomes contain the highest numbers of strain-specific gene clusters, greatly increasing the known Thiomonas genetic potential. Our results revealed that the FB strains are two distinct novel species of Thiomonas with the genetic potential for bioremediation of AMD via iron oxidation. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Shewanella is a ubiquitous bacterial genus of aquatic ecosystems, and its bacteriophages are also isolated from aquatic environments (oceans, lakes, ice, and wastewater). In this study, the isolation and characterization of a novel virulent Shewanella phage vB_SspS_KASIA and the identification of three prophages of its host, Shewanella sp. M16, including a mitomycin-inducible Mu-like siphovirus, vB_SspS_MuM16-1, became the starting point for comparative analyses of phages infecting Shewanella spp. and the determination of their position among the known bacterial viruses. A similarity networking analysis revealed the high diversity of Shewanella phages in general, with vB_SspS_KASIA clustering exclusively with Colwellia phage 9A, with which it forms a single viral cluster composed of two separate viral subclusters. Furthermore, vB_SspS_MuM16-1 presented itself as being significantly different from the phages deposited in public databases, expanding the diversity of the known Mu-like phages and giving potential molecular markers for the identification of Mu-like prophages in bacterial genomes. Moreover, the functional analysis performed for vB_SspS_KASIA suggested that, despite the KASIA host, the M16 strain grows better in a rich medium and at 30 °C the phage replication cycle seems to be optimal in restrictive culture condi-tions mimicking their natural environment, the Zloty Stok gold and arsenic mine. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Plastics pollution represents a global environmental crisis. In response, microbes are evolving the capacity to utilize synthetic polymers as carbon and energy sources. Recently, Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to secrete a two-enzyme system to deconstruct polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to its constituent monomers. Specifically, the I. sakaiensis PETase depolymerizes PET, liberating soluble products, including mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), which is cleaved to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol by MHETase. Here, we report a 1.6 Å resolution MHETase structure, illustrating that the MHETase core domain is similar to PETase, capped by a lid domain. Simulations of the catalytic itinerary predict that MHETase follows the canonical two-step serine hydrolase mechanism. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that MHETase evolved from ferulic acid esterases, and two homologous enzymes are shown to exhibit MHET turnover. Analysis of the two homologous enzymes and the MHETase S131G mutant demonstrates the importance of this residue for accommodation of MHET in the active site. We also demonstrate that the MHETase lid is crucial for hydrolysis of MHET and, furthermore, that MHETase does not turnover mono(2-hydroxyethyl)furanoate or mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-isophthalate. A highly synergistic relationship between PETase and MHETase was observed for the conversion of amorphous PET film to monomers across all nonzero MHETase concentrations tested. Finally, we compare the performance of MHETase:PETase chimeric proteins of varying linker lengths, which all exhibit improved PET and MHET turnover relative to the free enzymes. Together, these results offer insights into the two-enzyme PET depolymerization system and will inform future efforts in the biological deconstruction and upcycling of mixed plastics. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Polyextremophilic bacteria can thrive in environments with multiple stressors such as the Salar de Huasco (SH). Microbial communities in SH are exposed to low atmospheric pressure, high UV radiation, wide temperature ranges, salinity gradient and the presence of toxic compounds such as arsenic (As). In this work we focus on arsenic stress as one of the main adverse factors in SH and bacteria that belong to the Exiguobacterium genus due to their plasticity and ubiquity. Therefore, our aim was to shed light on the effect of niche conditions pressure (particularly arsenic), on the adaptation and divergence (at genotypic and phenotypic levels) of Exiguobacterium strains from five different SH sites. Also, to capture greater diversity in this genus, we use as outgroup five As(III) sensitive strains isolated from Easter Island (Chile) and The Great Salt Lake (United States). For this, samples were obtained from five different SH sites under an arsenic gradient (9 to 321 mg/kg: sediment) and isolated and sequenced the genomes of 14 Exiguobacterium strains, which had different arsenic tolerance levels. Then, we used comparative genomic analysis to assess the genomic divergence of these strains and their association with phenotypic differences such as arsenic tolerance levels and the ability to resist poly-stress. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SH strains share a common ancestor. Consequently, populations were separated and structured in different SH microenvironments, giving rise to multiple coexisting lineages. Hence, this genotypic variability is also evidenced by the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) composition and the size of their accessory genomes. Interestingly, these observations correlate with physiological traits such as growth patterns, gene expression, and enzyme activity related to arsenic response and/or tolerance. Therefore, Exiguobacterium strains from SH are adapted to physiologically overcome the contrasting environmental conditions, like the arsenic present in their habitat. © Copyright © 2020 Castro-Severyn, Pardo-Esté, Mendez, Morales, Marquez, Molina, Remonsellez, Castro-Nallar and Saavedra.},

	abstract = {Lateral gene transfer (LGT) has impacted prokaryotic genome evolution, yet the extent to which LGT compromises vertical evolution across individual genes and individual phyla is unknown, as are the factors that govern LGT frequency across genes. Estimating LGT frequency from tree comparisons is problematic when thousands of genomes are compared, because LGT becomes difficult to distinguish from phylogenetic artefacts. Here we report quantitative estimates for verticality across all genes and genomes, leveraging a well-known property of phylogenetic inference: phylogeny works best at the tips of trees. From terminal (tip) phylum level relationships, we calculate the verticality for 19,050,992 genes from 101,422 clusters in 5,655 prokaryotic genomes and rank them by their verticality. Among functional classes, translation, followed by nucleotide and cofactor biosynthesis, and DNA replication and repair are the most vertical. The most vertically evolving lineages are those rich in ecological specialists such as Acidithiobacilli, Chlamydiae, Chlorobi and Methanococcales. Lineages most affected by LGT are the α-, β-, γ-, and δ- classes of Proteobacteria and the Firmicutes. The 2,587 eukaryotic clusters in our sample having prokaryotic homologues fail to reject eukaryotic monophyly using the likelihood ratio test. The low verticality of α-proteobacterial and cyanobacterial genomes requires only three partners—an archaeal host, a mitochondrial symbiont, and a plastid ancestor—each with mosaic chromosomes, to directly account for the prokaryotic origin of eukaryotic genes. In terms of phylogeny, the 100 most vertically evolving prokaryotic genes are neither representative nor predictive for the remaining 97% of an average genome. In search of factors that govern LGT frequency, we find a simple but natural principle: Verticality correlates strongly with gene distribution density, LGT being least likely for intruding genes that must replace a preexisting homologue in recipient chromosomes. LGT is most likely for novel genetic material, intruding genes that encounter no competing copy. Copyright: © 2020 Nagies et al.

	abstract = {Diversity analyses of microbial enrichments obtained from deep sulfidic water (2000 m) collected from the Black Sea indicated the presence of eleven novel putative lineages of bacteria affiliated with the family Marinifilaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes. We obtained pure cultures of four strains (i.e. M1PT, M3P, A4T and 44) of this family, which can be grouped into two different clades based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences. All four strains were Gram-negative, rod-shaped and facultative anaerobic bacteria. The genomes of all strains were sequenced and physiological analyses were performed. All strains utilized a wide range of carbon sources, which was supported by the presence of the pathways involved in carbon utilization encoded by their genomes. The strains were able to grow at elevated hydrostatic pressure (up to 50 MPa), which coincided with an increased production of unsaturated and branched fatty acids and a decrease in hydroxy fatty acids. Intact polar lipid analysis of all four strains showed the production of ornithine lipids, phosphatidylethanolamines and capnine lipids as major intact polar lipids (IPLs). Genes involved in the hopanoid biosynthesis were also identified. However, bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) were not detected in either of the strains. Based on distinct physiological, chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phylogenetic differences to other members of the genera Ancylomarina and Labilibaculum, it was concluded that strain M1PT and A4T represent two novel species for which the names Ancylomarina euxinus sp. nov. and Labilibaculum euxinus sp. nov., respectively, are proposed. © 2020},

Conventional microbiological methods were used to isolate acidophilic bacterial strains from effluents emanating from the Colombian gold mine ‘El Zancudo’ (Titiribí, Antioquia). Despite the drainage waters having circumneutral pH, all of the isolated strains were phylogenetically related to the extreme acidophile Acidithiobacillus genus. However, based upon 16S rRNA gene sequences the mesophilic sulfur-oxidizing indigenous strains could not be assigned to a species. Pure cultures were selected by screening in medium with soluble inorganic arsenic (III) and their mineral-oxidative activity was evaluated at 30 °C in Erlenmeyer flasks with arsenopyrite ore under rotary shaking conditions. The indigenous strains were able to catalyze arsenopyrite oxidation in a mixed culture with a pulp density of 10%, maintaining their growth in the presence of >80mM leached arsenic. This research provides information regarding the isolation of arsenic resistant bacterial communities from neutral effluents from El Zancudo mine and the possibility of the isolated strains to be useful in the biooxidation pretreatment of refractory gold-bearing arsenopyrite ores and concentrates. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Waterlogged archaeological wood (WAW) is considered a precious material, first-hand account of past civilizations. Like any organic material, it is subjected to biodegradative action of microorganisms whose activity could be particularly fast and dangerous during the phases of excavation, storage and restoration. The present work aimed to characterize the microorganisms present inWAWduring these tricky periods to evaluate the biological risk it is exposed to. The bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting woods coming from two archaeological sites (Pisa and Naples) were investigated through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). High-throughput sequencing of extracted DNA fragments was performed using the reversible terminator-based sequencing chemistry with the Illumina MiSeq platform. The analyses revealed that the two archaeological sites showed distinct richness and biodiversity, as expected. In all theWAWs, the bacterial community harbored mainly Proteobacteria, whereas Bacteroidetes was well represented only in Naples communities and taxa belonging to the phyla Chloroflexi only in the Pisa site. Concerning the fungal community, the two sites were dominated by different phyla: Ascomycota for Naples samples and Basidiomycota for Pisa. Interestingly, most of the identified bacterial and fungal taxa have cellulolytic or ligninolytic ability. These results provide new and useful background information concerning the composition of WAW microbiota and the threat it represents for this precious material. © 2020 by the authors.},

This cytochrome c is specific for iron and interacts with periplasmic proteins to complete a reversible electron transport chain. A structure of Cyc2 has not yet been characterized experimentally. Here we describe a structural model of Cyc2, and associated proteins, to highlight a plausible mechanism for the ferrous iron electron transfer chain. A comparative modeling protocol specific for trans membrane beta barrel (TMBB) proteins in acidophilic conditions (pH ~ 2) was applied to the primary sequence of Cyc2. The proposed structure has three main regimes: Extracellular loops exposed to low-pH conditions, a TMBB, and an N-terminal cytochrome-like region within the periplasmic space. The Cyc2 model was further refined by identifying likely iron and heme docking sites. This represents the first computational model of Cyc2 that accounts for the membrane microenvironment and the acidity in the extracellular matrix. This approach can be used to model other TMBBs which can be critical for chemolithotrophic microbial growth. © 2021 The Protein Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Ferrovum spp. are abundant in acid mine drainage sites globally where they play an important role in biogeochemical cycling. All known taxa in this genus are Fe(II) oxidizers. Thus, co-occurring members of the genus could be competitors within the same environment. However, we found multiple, co-occurring Ferrovum spp. in Cabin Branch, an acid mine drainage site in the Daniel Boone National Forest, KY. Results: Here we describe the distribution of Ferrovum spp. within the Cabin Branch communities and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of two new Ferrovum spp. In contrast to previous studies, we recovered multiple 16S rRNA gene sequence variants suggesting the commonly used 97% cutoff may not be appropriate to differentiate Ferrovum spp. We also retrieved two nearly-complete Ferrovum spp. genomes from metagenomic data. The genomes of these taxa differ in several key ways relating to nutrient cycling, motility, and chemotaxis. Conclusions: Previously reported Ferrovum genomes are also diverse with respect to these categories suggesting that the genus Ferrovum contains substantial metabolic diversity. This diversity likely explains how the members of this genus successfully co-occur in Cabin Branch and why Ferrovum spp. are abundant across geochemical gradients. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Respiration is a major trait shaping the biology of many environments. Cytochrome oxidase containing heme A (COX) is a common terminal oxidase in aerobic bacteria and is the only one in mammalian mitochondria. The synthesis of heme A is catalyzed by heme A synthase (CtaA/Cox15), an enzyme that most likely coevolved with COX. The evolutionary origin of COX in bacteria has remained unknown. Using extensive sequence and phylogenetic analysis, we show that the ancestral type of heme A synthases is present in iron-oxidizing Proteobacteria such as Acidithiobacillus spp. These bacteria also contain a deep branching form of the major COX subunit (COX1) and an ancestral variant of CtaG, a protein that is specifically required for COX biogenesis. Our work thus suggests that the ancestors of extant iron-oxidizers were the first to evolve COX. Consistent with this conclusion, acidophilic iron-oxidizing prokaryotes lived on emerged land around the time for which there is the earliest geochemical evidence of aerobic respiration on earth. Hence, ecological niches of iron oxidation have apparently promoted the evolution of aerobic respiration. © Copyright © 2021 Degli Esposti, Moya-Beltrán, Quatrini and Hederstedt.},

	abstract = {A novel strain of the genus Promicromonospora, designated PT9T, was recovered from irradiated roots of the xerophyte Panicum turgidum collected from the Ksar Ghilane oasis in southern Tunisia. Strain PT9T is aerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram- positive actinomycete that produces branched hyphae and forms white to yellowish-white colonies. Chemotaxonomic features, including fatty acids, whole cell sugars and polar lipid profiles, support the assignment of PT9T to the genus Promicromonospora. The genomic relatedness indexes based on DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values revealed a significant genomic divergence between strain PT9T and all sequenced type strains of the taxon. Phylogenomic analysis showed that isolate PT9T was most closely related to Promicromonospora soli CGMCC 4.7398T. Phenotypic and phylogenomic analyses suggest that isolate PT9T represents a novel species of the genus Promicromonospora, for which the name Promicromonospora panici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PT9T (LMG 31103T = DSM 108613T).The isolate PT9T is an ionizing-radiation-resistant actinobacterium (D10 value = 2.6 kGy), with resistance to desiccation and hydrogen peroxide. The complete genome sequence of PT9T consists of 6,582,650 bps with 71.2% G+C content and 6291 protein-coding sequences. This genome will help to decipher the microbial genetic bases for ionizing-radiation resistance mechanisms including the response to oxidative stress. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria can be important primary producers in some meromictic lakes. Green sulfur bacteria (GSB) have been detected in ferruginous lakes, with some evidence that they are photosynthesizing using Fe(II) as an electron donor (i.e., photoferrotrophy). However, some photoferrotrophic GSB can also utilize reduced sulfur compounds, complicating the interpretation of Fe-dependent photosynthetic primary productivity. An enrichment (BLA1) from meromictic ferruginous Brownie Lake, Minnesota, United States, contains an Fe(II)-oxidizing GSB and a metabolically flexible putative Fe(III)-reducing anaerobe. “Candidatus Chlorobium masyuteum” grows photoautotrophically with Fe(II) and possesses the putative Fe(II) oxidase-encoding cyc2 gene also known from oxygen-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria. It lacks genes for oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds. Its genome encodes for hydrogenases and a reverse TCA cycle that may allow it to utilize H2 and acetate as electron donors, an inference supported by the abundance of this organism when the enrichment was supplied by these substrates and light. The anaerobe “Candidatus Pseudopelobacter ferreus” is in low abundance (∼1%) in BLA1 and is a putative Fe(III)-reducing bacterium from the Geobacterales ord. nov. While “Ca. C. masyuteum” is closely related to the photoferrotrophs C. ferroooxidans strain KoFox and C. phaeoferrooxidans strain KB01, it is unique at the genomic level. The main light-harvesting molecule was identified as bacteriochlorophyll c with accessory carotenoids of the chlorobactene series. BLA1 optimally oxidizes Fe(II) at a pH of 6.8, and the rate of Fe(II) oxidation was 0.63 ± 0.069 mmol day–1, comparable to other photoferrotrophic GSB cultures or enrichments. Investigation of BLA1 expands the genetic basis for phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation by GSB and highlights the role these organisms may play in Fe(II) oxidation and carbon cycling in ferruginous lakes. © Copyright © 2021 Lambrecht, Stevenson, Sheik, Pronschinske, Tong and Swanner.},

	abstract = {The potential metabolism and ecological roles of many microbial taxa remain unknown because insufficient genomic data are available to assess their functional potential. Two such microbial “dark matter” taxa are the Candidatus bacterial phyla Cloacimonadota and Omnitrophota, both of which have been identified in global anoxic environments, including (but not limited to) organic-carbon-rich lakes. Using 24 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained from an Antarctic lake (Ace Lake, Vestfold Hills), novel lineages and novel metabolic traits were identified for both phyla. The Cloacimonadota MAGs exhibited a capacity for carbon fixation using the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle driven by oxidation of hydrogen and sulfur. Certain Cloacimonadota MAGs encoded proteins that possess dockerin and cohesin domains, which is consistent with the assembly of extracellular cellulosome-like structures that are used for degradation of polypeptides and polysaccharides. The Omnitrophota MAGs represented phylogenetically diverse taxa that were predicted to possess a strong biosynthetic capacity for amino acids, nucleosides, fatty acids, and essential cofactors. All of the Omnitrophota were inferred to be obligate fermentative heterotrophs that utilize a relatively narrow range of organic compounds, have an incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle, and possess a single hydrogenase gene important for achieving redox balance in the cell. We reason that both Cloacimonadota and Omnitrophota form metabolic interactions with hydrogen-consuming partners (methanogens and Desulfobacterota, respectively) and, therefore, occupy specific niches in Ace Lake. © Copyright © 2021 Williams, Allen, Berengut and Cavicchioli.},

	abstract = {Proteins that oxidize extracellular substrates in Gram-positive bacteria are poorly understood. Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum is an actinobacterium that respires aerobically on extracellular ferrous ions at pH 1.5. In situ absorbance measurements were conducted on turbid suspensions of intact Fm. acidiphilum using an integrating cavity absorption meter designed for that purpose. Initial velocity kinetic studies monitored the appearance of product ferric ions in the presence of catalytic quanti-ties of cells. Cell-catalyzed iron oxidation obeyed the Michaelis-Menten equation with Kmand Vmax values of 71 µM and 0.29 fmol/min/cell, respectively. Limited-turnover kinetic studies were conducted with higher concentrations of cells to de-tect and monitor changes in the absorbance properties of cellular redox proteins when the cells were exposed to limited quantities of soluble reduced iron. A single a-type cytochrome with reduced absorbance peaks at 448 and 605 nm was the only redox-active chromophore that was visible as the cells respired aerobically on iron. The reduced cytochrome 605 exhibited mathematical and correlational properties that were consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of the cytochrome consti-tuted the rate-limiting step in the aerobic respiratory process, with a turnover num-ber of 35 ± 2 s-1. Genomic and proteomic analyses showed that Fm. acidiphilum could and did express only two a-type heme copper terminal oxidases. Cytochrome 605 was associated with the terminal oxidase gene that is located between nucleo-tides 31,090 and 33,039, inclusive, in the annotated circular genome of this bacte-rium. IMPORTANCE The identities and functions of proteins involved in aerobic respira-tion on extracellular ferrous ions at acidic pH are poorly understood in the four phyla of Gram-positive eukaryotes and archaea where such activities occur. In situ absorbance measurements were conducted on Fm. acidiphilum as it respired on ex-tracellular iron using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted accurate optical measurements in turbid suspensions of the intact bacterium under physio-logical conditions. The significance of these measurements is that they permitted a direct spectrophotometric examination of the extents and rates of biological elec-tron transfer events in situ under noninvasive physiological conditions without dis-rupting the complexity of the live cellular environment. One thing is certain: one way to understand how a protein functions in an intact organism is to actually ob-serve that protein as it functions in the intact organism. This paper provides an ex-ample of just such an observation. © 2020. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Life relies on the constant exchange of different forms of energy, i.e., on energy transduction. Therefore, organisms have evolved in a way to be able to harvest the energy made available by external sources (such as light or chemical compounds) and convert these into biological useable energy forms, such as the transmembrane difference of electrochemical potential (Δμ). Membrane proteins contribute to the establishment of Δμ by coupling exergonic catalytic reactions to the translocation of charges (electrons/ions) across the membrane. Irrespectively of the energy source and consequent type of reaction, all charge-translocating proteins follow two molecular coupling mechanisms: direct- or indirect-coupling, depending on whether the translocated charge is involved in the driving reaction. In this review, we explore these two coupling mechanisms by thoroughly examining the different types of charge-translocating membrane proteins. For each protein, we analyze the respective reaction thermodynamics, electron transfer/catalytic processes, charge-translocating pathways, and ion/substrate stoichiometries.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Diverse models have been advanced for the evolution of the genetic code. Here, models for tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and genetic code evolution were combined with an understanding of EF-Tu suppression of tRNA 3rd anticodon position wobbling. The result is a highly detailed scheme that describes the placements of all amino acids in the standard genetic code. The model describes evolution of 6-, 4-, 3-, 2- and 1-codon sectors. Innovation in column 3 of the code is explained. Wobbling and code degeneracy are explained. Separate distribution of serine sectors between columns 2 and 4 of the code is described. We conclude that very little chaos contributed to evolution of the genetic code and that the pattern of evolution of aaRS enzymes describes a history of the evolution of the code. A model is proposed to describe the biological selection for the earliest evolution of the code and for protocell evolution. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Aquatic environments of volcanic origin provide an exceptional opportunity to study the adaptations of microorganisms to early planet life conditions. Here, we characterized the prokaryotic communities and physicochemical properties of seepage sites at the bottom of the Poas Volcano crater and the Agrio River, two geologically related extremely acidic environments located in Costa Rica. Both locations hold a low pH (1.79–2.20) and have high sulfate and iron concentrations (Fe = 47–206 mg/L, SO42− = 1170–2460 mg/L), but significant differences in their temperature (90.0–95.0 ºC in the seepages at Poas Volcano, 19.1–26.6 ºC in Agrio River) and in the elemental sulfur content. Based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we determined that Sulfobacillus spp. represented more than half of the sequences in Poas Volcano seepage sites, while Agrio River was dominated by Leptospirillum and members of the archaeal order Thermoplasmatales. Both environments share some chemical characteristics and part of their microbiota, however, the temperature and the reduced sulfur are likely the main distinguishing features, ultimately shaping their microbial communities. Our data suggest that in the Poas Volcano–Agrio River system there is a common metabolism but with specialization of species that adapt to the physicochemical conditions of each environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Fe(II) oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction (NRFO) has been described for many environments. Yet very few autotrophic microorganisms catalysing NRFO have been cultivated and their diversity, as well as their mechanisms for NRFO in situ remain unclear. A novel autotrophic NRFO enrichment culture, named culture BP, was obtained from freshwater sediment. After more than 20 transfers, culture BP oxidized 8.22 mM of Fe(II) and reduced 2.42 mM of nitrate within 6.5 days under autotrophic conditions. We applied metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic analyses to culture BP to identify the microorganisms involved in autotrophic NRFO and to unravel their metabolism. Overall, twelve metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed, including a dominant Gallionellaceae sp. MAG (≥71% relative abundance). Genes and transcripts associated with potential Fe(II) oxidizers in culture BP, identified as a Gallionellaceae sp., Noviherbaspirillum sp., and Thiobacillus sp., were likely involved in metal oxidation (e.g., cyc2, mtoA), denitrification (e.g., nirK/S, norBC), carbon fixation (e.g., rbcL), and oxidative phosphorylation. The putative Fe(II)-oxidizing protein Cyc2 was detected for the Gallionellaceae sp. Overall, a complex network of microbial interactions among several Fe(II) oxidizers and denitrifiers was deciphered in culture BP that might resemble NRFO mechanisms in situ. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from environmental samples revealed 36 distinct Gallionellaceae taxa, including the key player of NRFO from culture BP (approx. 0.13% relative abundance in situ). Since several of these in situ-detected Gallionellaceae taxa were closely related to the key player in culture BP, this suggests that the diversity of organisms contributing to NRFO might be higher than currently known.  © 2021 },

	abstract = {Recent omics studies have provided invaluable insights into the metabolic potential, adaptation, and evolution of novel archaeal lineages from a variety of extreme environments. We utilized a genome-resolved metagenomic approach to recover eight medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that likely represent a new order ("Candidatus Sysuiplasmatales") in the class Thermoplasmata from mine tailings and acid mine drainage (AMD) sediments sampled from two copper mines in South China. 16S rRNA gene-based analyses revealed a narrow habitat range for these uncultured archaea limited to AMD and hot spring-related environments. Metabolic reconstruction indicated a facultatively anaerobic heterotrophic lifestyle. This may allow the archaea to adapt to oxygen fluctuations and is thus in marked contrast to the majority of lineages in the domain Archaea, which typically show obligately anaerobic metabolisms. Notably, "Ca. Sysuiplasmatales"could conserve energy through degradation of fatty acids, amino acid metabolism, and oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs), suggesting that they may contribute to acid generation in the extreme mine environments. Unlike the closely related orders Methanomassiliicoccales and "Candidatus Gimiplasmatales,""Ca. Sysuiplasmatales"lacks the capacity to perform methanogenesis and carbon fixation. Ancestral state reconstruction indicated that "Ca. Sysuiplasmatales,"the closely related orders Methanomassiliicoccales and "Ca. Gimiplasmatales,"and the orders SG8-5 and RBG-16-68-12 originated from a facultatively anaerobic ancestor capable of carbon fixation via the bacterial-type H4F Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP). Their metabolic divergence might be attributed to different evolutionary paths.  © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Here, we present the draft genome sequence of Pseudomonas sp. GC01, a cadmium-resistant Antarctic bacterium capable of biosynthesizing CdS fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) employing a unique mechanism involving the production of methanethiol (MeSH) from methionine (Met). To explore the molecular/metabolic components involved in QDs biosynthesis, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis, searching for the genes related to cadmium resistance and sulfur metabolic pathways. The genome of Pseudomonas sp. GC01 has a 4,706,645 bp size with a 58.61% G+C content. Pseudomonas sp. GC01 possesses five genes related to cadmium transport/resistance, with three P-type ATPases (cadA, zntA, and pbrA) involved in Cd-secretion that could contribute to the extracellular biosynthesis of CdS QDs. Furthermore, it exhibits genes involved in sulfate assimilation, cysteine/methionine synthesis, and volatile sulfur compounds catabolic pathways. Regarding MeSH production from Met, Pseudomonas sp. GC01 lacks the genes E4.4.1.11 and megL for MeSH generation. Interestingly, despite the absence of these genes, Pseudomonas sp. GC01 produces high levels of MeSH. This is probably associated with the metC gene that also produces MeSH from Met in bacteria. This work is the first report of the potential genes involved in Cd resistance, sulfur metabolism, and the process of MeSH-dependent CdS QDs bioproduction in Pseudomonas spp. strains. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {High sulfides concentrations can be poisonous to environment because of anthropogenic waste production or natural occurrences. How to elucidate the biological transformation mechanisms of sulfide pollutants in the subtropical marine mangrove ecosystem has gained increased interest. Thus, in the present study, the sulfide biotransformation in subtropical mangroves ecosystem was accurately evaluated using metagenomic sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Most abundant genes were related to the organic sulfur transformation. Furthermore, an ecological model of sulfide conversion was constructed. Total phosphorus was the dominant environmental factor that drove the sulfur cycle and microbial communities. We compared mangrove and non-mangrove soils and found that the former enhanced metabolism that was related to sulfate reduction when compared to the latter. Total organic carbon, total organic nitrogen, iron, and available sulfur were the key environmental factors that effectively influenced the dissimilatory sulfate reduction. The taxonomic assignment of dissimilatory sulfate-reducing genes revealed that Desulfobacterales and Chromatiales were mainly responsible for sulfate reduction. Chromatiales were most sensitive to environmental factors. The high abundance of cysE and cysK could contribute to the coping of the microbial community with the toxic sulfide produced by Desulfobacterales. Collectively, these findings provided a theoretical basis for the mechanism of the sulfur cycle in subtropical mangrove ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Diverse aerobic bacteria persist by consuming atmospheric hydrogen (H2) using group 1h [NiFe]-hydrogenases. However, other hydrogenase classes are also distributed in aerobes, including the group 2a [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Based on studies focused on Cyanobacteria, the reported physiological role of the group 2a [NiFe]-hydrogenase is to recycle H2 produced by nitrogenase. However, given this hydrogenase is also present in various heterotrophs and lithoautotrophs lacking nitrogenases, it may play a wider role in bacterial metabolism. Here we investigated the role of this enzyme in three species from different phylogenetic lineages and ecological niches: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (phylum Proteobacteria), Chloroflexus aggregans (phylum Chloroflexota), and Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (phylum Gemmatimonadota). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the group 2a [NiFe]-hydrogenase of all three species is significantly upregulated during exponential growth compared to stationary phase, in contrast to the profile of the persistence-linked group 1h [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Whole-cell biochemical assays confirmed that all three strains aerobically respire H2 to sub-atmospheric levels, and oxidation rates were much higher during growth. Moreover, the oxidation of H2 supported mixotrophic growth of the carbon-fixing strains C. aggregans and A. ferrooxidans. Finally, we used phylogenomic analyses to show that this hydrogenase is widely distributed and is encoded by 13 bacterial phyla. These findings challenge the current persistence-centric model of the physiological role of atmospheric H2 oxidation and extend this process to two more phyla, Proteobacteria and Gemmatimonadota. In turn, these findings have broader relevance for understanding how bacteria conserve energy in different environments and control the biogeochemical cycling of atmospheric trace gases. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Burkea Africana is a leguminous tree used for medicinal purposes, growing in clusters, on soils impoverished from most nutrients. The study aimed to determine the factors responsible for successful reproduction and establishment of the B. africana trees in nature, as all efforts for commercial production has been proven unsuccessful. An investigation was carried out to determine the metabolomic profile, chemical composition, and microbial composition of the soils where B. Africana grows (Burkea soil) versus the soil where it does not grow (non-Burkea soil). 1H-NMR metabolomic analysis showed different metabolites in the respective soils. Trehalose and betaine, as well as a choline-like and carnitine-like compound, were found to be in higher concentration in Burkea soils, whereas, acetate, lactate, and formate were concentrated in non-Burkea soils. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of numerous amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamine to be higher in Burkea soils. Since it was previously suggested that the soil microbial diversity is the major driver for establishment and survival of seedlings in nature, Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted and a BLAST analysis conducted for species identification. Penicillium species was found to be highly prevalent and discriminant between the two soils, associated with the Burkea soils. No differences in the bacterial composition of Burkea and non-Burkea soils were observed. The variances in fungal composition suggests that species supremacy play a role in development of B. africana trees and is responsible for creating a supporting environment for natural establishment and survival of seedlings. © 2020, MDPI AG.

	abstract = {Proteus mirabilis is a pathogenic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that causes ascending urinary tract infections. Swarming motility, urease production, biofilm formation, and the properties of its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are all factors that contribute to the virulence of this bacterium. Uniquely, members of the O18 serogroup elaborate LPS molecules capped with O antigen polymers built of pentasaccharide repeats; these repeats are modified with a phosphocholine (ChoP) moiety attached to the proximal sugar of each O unit. Decoration of the LPS with ChoP is an important surface modification of many pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The presence of ChoP on the bacterial envelope is correlated with pathogenicity, as decoration with ChoP plays a role in bacterial adhesion to mucosal surfaces, resistance to antimicrobial peptides and sensitivity to complement-mediated killing in several species. The genome of P. mirabilis O18 is 3.98 Mb in size, containing 3,762 protein-coding sequences and an overall GC content of 38.7%. Annotation performed using the RAST Annotation Server revealed genes associated with choline phosphorylation, uptake and transfer. Moreover, amino acid sequence alignment of the translated licC gene revealed it to be homologous to LicC from Streptococcus pneumoniae encoding CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. Recognized homologs are located in the O antigen gene clusters of Proteus species, near the wzx gene encoding the O antigen flippase, which translocates lipid-linked O units across the inner membrane. This study reveals the genes potentially engaged in LPS decoration with ChoP in P. mirabilis O18. © Copyright © 2021 Czerwonka, Gmiter and Durlik-Popińska.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities from a lake and river flowing through a highly dense urbanized township in Malaysia were profiled by sequencing amplicons of the 16S V3–V4 and 18S V9 hypervariable rRNA gene regions via Illumina MiSeq. Results revealed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant prokaryotic phyla; whereas, eukaryotic communities were predominantly of the SAR clade and Opisthokonta. The abundance of Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium in all sites suggested the possible presence of pathogens in the urban water systems, supported by the most probable number (MPN) values of more than 1600 per 100 mL. Urbanization could have impacted the microbial communities as transient communities (clinical, water-borne and opportunistic pathogens) coexisted with common indigenous aquatic communities (Cyanobacteria). It was concluded that in urban water systems, microbial communities vary in their abundance of microbial phyla detected along the water systems. The influences of urban land use and anthropogenic activities influenced the physicochemical properties and the microbial dynamics in the water systems. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

	abstract = {Acid mine drainages (AMDs), metal-rich acidic effluents generated by mining activities, are colonized by prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms widely distributed among different phyla. We compared metatranscriptomic data from two sampling stations in the Carnoulès AMD and from a third station in the nearby Amous River, focussing on processes involved in primary production and litter decomposition. A synergistic relationship between the green and brown food webs was favoured in the AMD sediments by the low carbon content and the availability of mineral nutrients: primary production of organic matter would benefit C-limited decomposers whose activity of organic matter mineralization would in turn profit primary producers. This balance could be locally disturbed by heterogeneous factors such as an input of plant debris from the riparian vegetation, strongly boosting the growth of Tremellales which would then outcompete primary producers. In the unpolluted Amous River on the contrary, the competition for limited mineral nutrients was dominated by the green food web, fish and bacterivorous protists having a positive effect on phytoplankton. These results suggest that in addition to direct effects of low pH and metal contamination, trophic conditions like carbon or mineral nutrient limitations also have a strong impact on assembly and activities of AMDs' microbial communities. © 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Microbial iron cycling influences the flux of major nutrients in the environment (e.g., through the adsorptive capacity of iron oxides) and includes biotically induced iron oxidation and reduction processes. The ecological extent of microbial iron cycling is not well understood, even with increased sequencing efforts, in part due to limitations in gene annotation pipelines and limitations in experimental studies linking phenotype to genotype. This is particularly true for the marine subseafloor, which remains undersampled, but represents the largest contiguous habitat on Earth. To address this limitation, we used FeGenie, a database and bioinformatics tool that identifies microbial iron cycling genes and enables the development of testable hypotheses on the biogeochemical cycling of iron. Herein, we survey the microbial iron cycle in diverse subseafloor habitats, including sediment-buried crustal aquifers, as well as surficial and deep sediments. We inferred the genetic potential for iron redox cycling in 32 of the 46 metagenomes included in our analysis, demonstrating the prevalence of these activities across underexplored subseafloor ecosystems. We show that while some processes (e.g., iron uptake and storage, siderophore transport potential, and iron gene regulation) are near-universal, others (e.g., iron reduction/oxidation, siderophore synthesis, and magnetosome formation) are dependent on local redox and nutrient status. Additionally, we detected niche-specific differences in strategies used for dissimilatory iron reduction, suggesting that geochemical constraints likely play an important role in dictating the dominant mechanisms for iron cycling. Overall, our survey advances the known distribution, magnitude, and potential ecological impact of microbe-mediated iron cycling and utilization in sub-benthic ecosystems. © Copyright © 2021 Garber, Cohen, Nealson, Ramírez, Barco, Enzingmüller-Bleyl, Gehringer and Merino.},

The genome comparisons reveal that extensive intraspecific variation occurs in their genomes, and that the loss and insertion of novel gene blocks of probable phage origin may mostly contribute to heterogeneity of gene content among L. ferriphilum genomes. Surprisingly, a nif gene cluster is identified in L. ferriphilum YSK and L. ferriphilum ZJ genomes. Intensive analysis and further experiments indicate that the nif gene cluster in L. ferriphilum YSK inherits from ancestor rather than lateral gene transfer. Overall, results suggest that the population of L. ferriphilum undergoes frequent genetic recombination, resulting in many closely related genome types in recent evolution.

They carry antibiotic resistance genes, and it has been shown that they confer resistance to β‐lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim, sulphonamides, and tetracycline. The previously proposed classification system divides the plasmid group into four subgroups, i.e., IncQ‐1, IncQ‐2, IncQ‐3, and IncQ‐4. The last two subgroups have been poorly described so far. The aim of this study was to analyze five newly identified IncQ‐3 plasmids isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in Poland and to compare them with all known plasmids belonging to the IncQ‐3 subgroup whose sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database. The complete nucleotide sequences of the novel plasmids were annotated and bioinformatic analyses were performed, including identification of core genes and auxiliary genetic load. Furthermore, functional experiments testing plasmid mobility were carried out. Phylogenetic analysis based on three core genes (repA, mobA/repB, and mobC) revealed the presence of three main clusters of IncQ‐3 replicons. Apart from having a highly conserved core, the analyzed IncQ‐3 plasmids were vectors of antibiotic resistance genes, including (I) the qnrS2 gene that encodes fluoroquinolone resistance and (II) β‐lactam, trimethoprim, and aminoglycoside resistance genes within integron cassettes. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {In previous work, lab-scale reactors designed to study microbial Fe(II) oxidation rates at low pH were found to have stable rates under a wide range of pH and Fe(II) concentrations. Since the stirred reactor environment eliminates many of the temporal and spatial variations that promote high diversity among microbial populations in nature, we were surprised that the reactors supported multiple taxa presumed to be autotrophic Fe(II) oxidizers based on their phylogeny. Metagenomic analyses of the reactor communities revealed differences in the metabolic potential of these taxa with respect to Fe(II) oxidation and carbon fixation pathways, acquisition of potentially growth-limiting substrates and the ability to form biofilms. Our findings support the hypothesis that the long-term co-existence of multiple autotrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing populations in the reactors are due to distinct metabolic potential that supports differential growth in response to limiting resources such as nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen. Our data also highlight the role of biofilms in creating spatially distinct geochemical niches that enable the co-existence of multiple taxa that occupy the same apparent metabolic niche when the system is viewed in bulk. The distribution of key metabolic functions across different co-existing taxa supported functional redundancy and imparted process stability to these reactors. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Riemerella anatipestifer is a gram-negative bacterium that leads to severe contagious septicemia in ducks, turkeys, chickens, and wild waterfowl. Here, a pan-genome with 32 R. anatipestifer genomes is re-established, and the mathematical model is calculated to evaluate the expansion of R. anatipestifer genomes, which were determined to be open. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and phylogenetic analysis preliminarily clarify intraspecies variation and distance. Comparative genomic analysis of R. anatipestifer found that horizontal gene transfer events, which provide an expressway for the recruitment of novel functionalities and facilitate genetic diversity in microbial genomes, play a key role in the process of acquiring and transmitting antibiotic-resistance genes in R. anatipestifer. Furthermore, a new antibiotic-resistance gene cluster was identified in the same loci in 14 genomes. The uneven distribution of virulence factors was also confirmed by our results. Our study suggests that the ability to acquire foreign genes (such as antibiotic-resistance genes) increases the adaptability of R. anatipestifer, and the virulence genes with little mobility are highly conserved in R. anatipestifer. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the diversity and distribution of viruses infecting green sulfur bacteria (GSB) thriving in euxinic (sulfuric and anoxic) habitats, including gypsum karst lake ecosys-tems. In this study, we used targeted cell sorting combined with single-cell sequencing to gain insights into the gene content and genomic potential of viruses infecting sulfur-oxidizing bacteria Chlorobium clathratiforme, obtained from water samples collected during summer stratification in gypsum karst Lake Kirkilai (Lithuania). In total, 82 viral contigs were bioinformatically identified in 62 single amplified genomes (SAGs) of C. clathratiforme. The majority of viral gene and protein sequences showed little to no similarity with phage sequences in public databases, uncovering the vast diversity of previously undescribed GSB viruses. We observed a high level of lysoge-nization in the C. clathratiforme population, as 87% SAGs contained intact prophages. Among the thirty identified auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), two, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) and thioredoxin-dependent phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase (cysH), were found to be involved in the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds, suggesting that viruses can influence the metabolism and cycling of this essential element. Finally, the analysis of CRISPR spacers retrieved from the consensus C. clathratiforme genome imply persistent and active virus–host interactions for several putative phages prevalent among C. clathratiforme SAGs. Overall, this study provides a glimpse into the diversity of phages associated with naturally occurring and highly abundant sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: The current view suggests that in low-temperature acidic environments, archaea are significantly less abundant than bacteria. Thus, this study of the microbiome of Parys Mountain (Anglesey, UK) sheds light on the generality of this current assumption. Parys Mountain is a historically important copper mine and its acid mine drainage (AMD) water streams are characterised by constant moderate temperatures (8-18 °C), extremely low pH (1.7) and high concentrations of soluble iron and other metal cations. Results: Metagenomic and SSU rRNA amplicon sequencing of DNA from Parys Mountain revealed a significant proportion of archaea affiliated with Euryarchaeota, which accounted for ca. 67% of the community. Within this phylum, potentially new clades of Thermoplasmata were overrepresented (58%), with the most predominant group being "E-plasma", alongside low-abundant Cuniculiplasmataceae, 'Ca. Micrarchaeota' and 'Terrestrial Miscellaneous Euryarchaeal Group' (TMEG) archaea, which were phylogenetically close to Methanomassilicoccales and clustered with counterparts from acidic/moderately acidic settings. In the sediment, archaea and Thermoplasmata contributed the highest numbers in V3-V4 amplicon reads, in contrast with the water body community, where Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria outnumbered archaea. Cultivation efforts revealed the abundance of archaeal sequences closely related to Cuniculiplasma divulgatum in an enrichment culture established from the filterable fraction of the water sample. Enrichment cultures with unfiltered samples showed the presence of Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum, C. divulgatum, 'Ca. Mancarchaeum acidiphilum Mia14', 'Ca. Micrarchaeota'-related and diverse minor (< 2%) bacterial metagenomic reads. Conclusion: Contrary to expectation, our study showed a high abundance of archaea in this extremely acidic mine-impacted environment. Further, archaeal populations were dominated by one particular group, suggesting that they are functionally important. The prevalence of archaea over bacteria in these microbiomes and their spatial distribution patterns represents a novel and important advance in our understanding of acidophile ecology. We also demonstrated a procedure for the specific enrichment of cell wall-deficient members of the archaeal component of this community, although the large fraction of archaeal taxa remained unculturable. Lastly, we identified a separate clustering of globally occurring acidophilic members of TMEG that collectively belong to a distinct order within Thermoplasmata with yet unclear functional roles in the ecosystem. © 2019 The Author(s).},

The relatively high concentrations of hydrothermal fluids permeating the soil produced acidic conditions and whitish deposits that characterize the Solfatara Crater floor. Archaea and Bacteria showed almost equal cell abundance (up to 3.2 × 107 and 4.2 × 107 cell/g, respectively) with relatively low levels of biodiversity and equitability in sites characterized by elevated temperatures (up to 70◦C), very low pH values (up to 2.2) and reducing conditions. In these sites, high-throughput sequencing showed the marked selection of microorganisms, mainly affiliated with the genera Thermoplasma, Ferroplasma and Acidithiobacillus. A relatively high biodiversity and concomitant distinctive structure of the microbial community were observed in soils poorly affected by fumarolic emissions that were oxic and rich in organic matter. © FEMS 2018.

	abstract = {                             Extreme environments typically require costly adaptations for survival, an attribute that often translates to an elevated influence of habitat conditions on biotic communities. Microbes, primarily bacteria, are successful colonizers of extreme environments worldwide, yet in many instances, the interplay between harsh conditions, dispersal, and microbial biogeography remains unclear. This lack of clarity is particularly true for habitats where extreme temperature is not the overarching stressor, highlighting a need for studies that focus on the role other primary stressors (e.g., toxicants) play in shaping biogeographic patterns. In this study, we leveraged a naturally paired stream system in southern Mexico to explore how elevated hydrogen sulfide (H                             2                             S) influences microbial diversity. We sequenced a portion of the 16S rRNA gene using bacterial primers for water sampled from three geographically proximate pairings of streams with high (> 20 μM) or low (~ 0 μM) H                             2                             S concentrations. After exploring bacterial diversity within and among sites, we compared our results to a previous study of macroinvertebrates and fish for the same sites. By spanning multiple organismal groups, we were able to illuminate how H                             2                             S may differentially affect biodiversity. The presence of elevated H                             2                             S had no effect on overall bacterial diversity (p = 0.21), a large effect on community composition (25.8% of variation explained, p < 0.0001), and variable influence depending upon the group—whether fish, macroinvertebrates, or bacteria—being considered. For bacterial diversity, we recovered nine abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that comprised a core H                             2                             S-rich stream microbiome in the region. Many H                             2                             S-associated OTUs were members of the Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which both have been implicated in endosymbiotic relationships between sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting the potential for symbioses that remain to be discovered in these habitats.                          © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

LAB are also present in the human gut, which has often been exploited as a reservoir of potential novel probiotic strains, but several parameters need to be assessed before establishing their safety and potential use for human consumption. In the present study, six L. helveticus strains isolated from natural whey cultures were analyzed for their phenotype and genotype in exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, low pH and bile salt tolerance, bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, and antibiotic resistance profile. In addition, a comparative genomic investigation was performed between the six newly sequenced strains and the 51 publicly available genomes of L. helveticus to define the pangenome structure. The results indicate that the newly sequenced strain UC1267 and the deposited strain DSM 20075 can be considered good candidates for gut-adapted strains due to their ability to survive in the presence of 0.2% glycocholic acid (GCA) and 1% taurocholic and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA). Moreover, these strains had the highest bile salt deconjugation activity among the tested L. helveticus strains. Considering the safety profile, none of these strains presented antibiotic resistance phenotypically and/or at the genome level. The pangenome analysis revealed genes specific to the new isolates, such as enzymes related to folate biosynthesis in strains UC1266 and UC1267 and an integrated phage in strain UC1035. Finally, the presence of maltose-degrading enzymes and multiple copies of 6-phospho-ß-glucosidase genes in our strains indicates the capability to metabolize sugars other than lactose, which is related solely to dairy niches. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

	abstract = {The first complete genome of the biotechnologically important species Sulfobacillus thermotolerans has been sequenced. Its 3 317 203-bp chromosome contains an 83 269-bp plasmid-like region, which carries heavy metal resistance determinants and the rusticyanin gene. Plasmid-mediated metal resistance is unusual for acidophilic chemolithotrophs. Moreover, most of their plasmids are cryptic and do not contribute to the phenotype of the host cells. A polyphosphate-based mechanism of metal resistance, which has been previously unknown in the genus Sulfobacillus or other Gram-positive chemolithotrophs, potentially operates in two Sulfobacillus species. The methylcitrate cycle typical for pathogens and identified in the genus Sulfobacillus for the first time can fulfill the energy and/or protective function in S. thermotolerans Kr1 and two other Sulfobacillus species, which have incomplete glyoxylate cycles. It is notable that the TCA cycle, disrupted in all Sulfobacillus isolates under optimal growth conditions, proved to be complete in the cells enduring temperature stress. An efficient antioxidant defense system gives S. thermotolerans another competitive advantage in the microbial communities inhabiting acidic metal-rich environments. The genomic comparisons revealed 80 unique genes in the strain Kr1, including those involved in lactose/galactose catabolism. The results provide new insights into metabolism and resistance mechanisms in the Sulfobacillus genus and other acidophiles. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A bacterial consortium was enriched from gold particles that 'experienced' ca. 80 years of biotransformation within waste-rock piles (Australia). This bacterial consortium was exposed to 10 μM AuCl3 to obtain Au-tolerant bacteria. From these isolates, Serratia sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp. were the most Au-tolerant and reduced soluble Au as pure gold nanoparticles, indicating that passive mineralisation is a mechanism for mediating the toxic effect of soluble Au produced during particle dissolution. Genome-wide analysis demonstrated that these isolates also possessed various genes that could provide cellular defence enabling survival under heavy-metal stressed condition by mediating the toxicity of heavy metals through active efflux/reduction. Diverse metal-resistant genes or genes clusters (cop, cus, czc, znt and ars) were detected, which could confer resistance to soluble Au. Comparative genome analysis revealed that the majority of detected heavy-metal resistant genes were similar (i.e. orthologous) to those genes of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34. The detection of heavy-metal resistance, nutrient cycling and biofilm formation genes (pgaABCD, bsmA and hmpS) may have indirect yet important roles when dealing with soluble Au during particle dissolution. In conclusion, the physiological and genomic results suggest that bacteria living on gold particles would likely use various genes to ensure survival during Au-biogeochemical cycling. © FEMS 2020.

	abstract = {The actinobacterium Streptomyces sp. MC1 has previously shown the capacity to resist and remove Cr(VI) from liquid culture media. The aim of this work is to analyze the differential expression pattern of intracellular proteins when Streptomyces sp. MC1 is exposed to Cr(VI) in order to explain the molecular mechanisms of resistance that this microorganism possesses. For this purpose, 2D-PAGE and shotgun proteomic analyses (2D-nanoUPLC-ESI-MS/MS) were applied. The presence of Cr(VI) induced the expression of proteins involved in molecular biosynthesis and energy generation, chaperones with a key role in the repair of misfolded proteins and stress response, transcription proteins, proteins of importance in the DNA supercoiling, repair and replication, and dehydrogenases involved in oxidation–reduction processes. These dehydrogenases can be associated with the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The results of this study show that proteins from the groups mentioned before are important to face the stress caused by the Cr(VI) presence and help the microorganism to counteract the toxicity of the metal. The use of two proteomic approaches resulted in a larger number of peptides identified, which is also transduced in a significant number of protein ID. This decreased the potential complexity of the sample because of the protein dynamic range, as well as increased the recovery of peptides from the gel after digestion. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In natural environments microorganisms encounter extreme changes in temperature, pH, osmolarities and nutrient availability. The stress response of many bacterial species has been described in detail, however, knowledge in Archaea is limited. Here, we describe the cellular response triggered by nutrient limitation in the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. We measured changes in gene transcription and protein abundance upon nutrient depletion up to 4 h after initiation of nutrient depletion. Transcript levels of 1118 of 2223 protein coding genes and abundance of approximately 500 proteins with functions in almost all cellular processes were affected by nutrient depletion. Our study reveals a significant rerouting of the metabolism with respect to degradation of internal as well as extracellular-bound organic carbon and degradation of proteins. Moreover, changes in membrane lipid composition were observed in order to access alternative sources of energy and to maintain pH homeostasis. At transcript level, the cellular response to nutrient depletion in S. acidocaldarius seems to be controlled by the general transcription factors TFB2 and TFEβ. In addition, ribosome biogenesis is reduced, while an increased protein degradation is accompanied with a loss of protein quality control. This study provides first insights into the early cellular response of Sulfolobus to organic carbon and organic nitrogen depletion. © 2019 Frontiers Media S.A. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Phytostabilized highly acidic, pyritic mine tailings are susceptible to re-acidification over time despite initial addition of neutralizing amendments. Studies examining plant-associated microbial dynamics during re-acidification of phytostabilized regions are sparse. To address this, we characterized the rhizosphere and bulk bacterial communities of buffalo grass used in the phytostabilization of metalliferous, pyritic mine tailings undergoing re-acidification at the Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter Superfund Site in Dewey-Humboldt, AZ. Plant-associated substrates representing a broad pH range (2.35-7.76) were sampled to (1) compare the microbial diversity and community composition of rhizosphere and bulk compartments across a pH gradient, and (2) characterize how re-acidification affects the abundance and activity of the most abundant plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB; including N2-fixing) versus acid-generating bacteria (AGB; including Fe-cycling/S-oxidizing). Results indicated that a shift in microbial diversity and community composition occurred at around pH 4. At higher pH (>4) the species richness and community composition of the rhizosphere and bulk compartments were similar, and PGPB, such as Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Devosia, Phyllobacterium, Sinorhizobium, and Hyphomicrobium, were present and active in both compartments with minimal presence of AGB. In comparison, at lower pH (<4) the rhizosphere had a significantly higher number of species than the bulk (p < 0.05) and the compartments had significantly different community composition (unweighted UniFrac; PERMANOVA, p < 0.05). Whereas some PGPB persisted in the rhizosphere at lower pH, including Arthrobacter and Devosia, they were absent from the bulk. Meanwhile, AGB dominated in both compartments; the most abundant were the Fe-oxidizer Leptospirillum and Fe-reducers Acidibacter and Acidiphilium, and the most active was the Fe-reducer Aciditerrimonas. This predominance of AGB at lower pH, and even their minimal presence at higher pH, contributes to acidifying conditions and poses a significant threat to sustainable plant establishment. These findings have implications for phytostabilization field site management and suggest re-application of compost or an alternate buffering material may be required in regions susceptible to re-acidification to maintain a beneficial bacterial community conducive to long-term plant establishment.

	abstract = {1,4-Dioxane, a co-contaminant at many chlorinated solvent sites, is a problematic groundwater pollutant because of risks to human health and characteristics which make remediation challenging. In situ 1,4-dioxane bioremediation has recently been shown to be an effective remediation strategy. However, the presence/abundance of 1,4-dioxane degrading species across different environmental samples is generally unknown. Here, the objectives were to identify which 1,4-dioxane degrading functional genes are present and which genera may be using 1,4-dioxane and/or metabolites to support growth across different microbial communities. For this, laboratory sample microcosms and abiotic control microcosms (containing media) were inoculated with four uncontaminated soils and sediments from two contaminated sites. Live control microcosms were treated in the same manner, except 1,4-dioxane was not added. 1,4-Dioxane decreased in live microcosms with all six inocula, but not in the abiotic controls, suggesting biodegradation occurred. A comparison of live sample microcosms and live controls (no 1,4-dioxane) indicated nineteen genera were enriched following exposure to 1,4-dioxane, suggesting a growth benefit for 1,4-dioxane biodegradation. The three most enriched were Mycobacterium, Nocardioides, and Kribbella (classifying as Actinomycetales). There was also a higher level of enrichment for Arthrobacter, Nocardia, and Gordonia (all three classifying as Actinomycetales) in one soil, Hyphomicrobium (Rhizobiales) in another soil, Clavibacter (Actinomycetales) and Bartonella (Rhizobiales) in another soil, and Chelativorans (Rhizobiales) in another soil. Although Arthrobacter, Mycobacterium, and Nocardia have previously been linked to 1,4-dioxane degradation, Nocardioides, Gordonia, and Kribbella are potentially novel degraders. The analysis of the functional genes associated with 1,4-dioxane demonstrated three genes were present at higher relative abundance values, including Rhodococcus sp. RR1 prmA, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 prmA, and Burkholderia cepacia G4 tomA3. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the identity of the multiple genera and functional genes associated with aerobic degradation of 1,4-dioxane in mixed communities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Several abundant but yet uncultivated bacterial groups exist in extreme iron- and sulfur-rich environments, and the physiology, biodiversity, and ecological roles of these bacteria remain a mystery. Here we retrieved four metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from an artificial acid mine drainage (AMD) system, and propose they belong to a new deltaproteobacterial order, Candidatus Acidulodesulfobacterales. The distribution pattern of Ca. Acidulodesulfobacterales in AMDs across Southeast China correlated strongly with ferrous iron. Reconstructed metabolic pathways and gene expression profiles showed that they were likely facultatively anaerobic autotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation. In addition to dissimilatory sulfate reduction, encoded by dsrAB, dsrD, dsrL, and dsrEFH genes, these microorganisms might also oxidize sulfide, depending on oxygen concentration and/or oxidation reduction potential. Several genes with homology to those involved in iron metabolism were also identified, suggesting their potential role in iron cycling. In addition, the expression of abundant resistance genes revealed the mechanisms of adaptation and response to the extreme environmental stresses endured by these organisms in the AMD environment. These findings shed light on the distribution, diversity, and potential ecological role of the new order Ca. Acidulodesulfobacterales in nature. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Prediction of proteins’ secondary structure is one of the major steps in the generation of homology models. These models provide structural information which is used to design suitable ligands for potential medicinal targets. However, selecting a proper tool between multiple Secondary Structure Prediction (SSP) options is challenging. The current study is an insight into currently favored methods and tools, within various contexts. Objective: A systematic review was performed for a comprehensive access to recent (2013-2016) studies which used or recommended protein SSP tools. Methods: Three databases, Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched and 99 out of the 209 studies were finally found eligible to extract data. Results: Four categories of applications for 59 retrieved SSP tools were: (I) prediction of structural features of a given sequence, (II) evaluation of a method, (III) providing input for a new SSP method and (IV) integrating an SSP tool as a component for a program. PSIPRED was found to be the most popular tool in all four categories. JPred and tools utilizing PHD (Profile network from HeiDelberg) method occupied second and third places of popularity in categories I and II. JPred was only found in the two first categories, while PHD was present in three fields. Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive insight into the recent usage of SSP tools which could be helpful for selecting a proper tool. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication system that uses autoinducers as signaling molecules to enable inter-species and intra-species interactions in response to external stimuli according to the population density. QS allows bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii to react rapidly in response to environmental changes and hence, increase the chances of survival. A. baumannii is one of the causative agents in hospital-acquired infections and the number of cases has increased remarkably in the past decade. In this study, A. baumannii strain 863, a multidrug-resistant pathogen, was found to exhibit QS activity by producing N-acyl homoserine lactone. We identified the autoinducer synthase gene, which we named abaI, by performing whole genome sequencing analysis of A. baumannii strain 863. Using high resolution tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, we reported that abaI of A. baumannii strain 863 produced 3-hydroxy-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone. A gene deletion mutant was constructed, which confirmed the functionality of abaI. A growth defect was observed in the QS-deficient mutant strain. Transcriptome profiling was performed to determine the possible genes regulated by QS. Four groups of genes that showed differential expression were discovered, namely those involved in carbon source metabolism, energy production, stress response and the translation process. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Dimethylsulfide is a volatile organic sulfur compound that provides the largest input of biogenic sulfur from the oceans to the atmosphere, and thence back to land, constituting an important link in the global sulfur cycle. Microorganisms degrading DMS affect fluxes of DMS in the environment, but the underlying metabolic pathways are still poorly understood. Methylophaga thiooxydans is a marine methylotrophic bacterium capable of growth on DMS as sole source of carbon and energy. Using proteomics and transcriptomics we identified genes expressed during growth on dimethylsulfide and methanol to refine our knowledge of the metabolic pathways that are involved in DMS and methanol degradation in this strain. Amongst the most highly expressed genes on DMS were the two methanethiol oxidases driving the oxidation of this reactive and toxic intermediate of DMS metabolism. Growth on DMS also increased expression of the enzymes of the tetrahydrofolate linked pathway of formaldehyde oxidation, in addition to the tetrahydromethanopterin linked pathway. Key enzymes of the inorganic sulfur oxidation pathway included flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, and persulfide dioxygenases. A sulP permease was also expressed during growth on DMS. Proteomics and transcriptomics also identified a number of highly expressed proteins and gene products whose function is currently not understood. As the identity of some enzymes of organic and inorganic sulfur metabolism previously detected in Methylophaga has not been characterized at the genetic level yet, highly expressed uncharacterized genes provide new targets for further biochemical and genetic analysis. A pan-genome analysis of six available Methylophaga genomes showed that only two of the six investigated strains, M. thiooxydans and M. sulfidovorans have the gene encoding methanethiol oxidase, suggesting that growth on methylated sulfur compounds of M. aminisulfidivorans is likely to involve different enzymes and metabolic intermediates. Hence, the pathways of DMS-utilization and subsequent C1 and sulfur oxidation are not conserved across Methylophaga isolates that degrade methylated sulfur compounds. © 2019 Kröber and Schäfer.

	abstract = {The Zetaproteobacteria are a class of bacteria typically associated with marine Fe(II)-oxidizing environments. First discovered in the hydrothermal vents at Loihi Seamount, Hawaii, they have become model organisms for marine microbial Fe(II) oxidation. In addition to deep sea and shallow hydrothermal vents, Zetaproteobacteria are found in coastal sediments, other marine subsurface environments, steel corrosion biofilms and saline terrestrial springs. Isolates from a range of environments all grow by autotrophic Fe(II) oxidation. Their success lies partly in their microaerophily, which enables them to compete with abiotic Fe(II) oxidation at Fe(II)-rich oxic/anoxic transition zones. To determine the known diversity of the Zetaproteobacteria, we have used 16S rRNA gene sequences to define 59 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), at 97% similarity. While some Zetaproteobacteria taxa appear to be cosmopolitan, others are enriched by specific habitats. OTU networks show that certain Zetaproteobacteria co-exist, sharing compatible niches. These niches may correspond with adaptations to O2, H2 and nitrate availability, based on genomic analyses of metabolic potential. Also, a putative Fe(II) oxidation gene has been found in diverse Zetaproteobacteria taxa, suggesting that the Zetaproteobacteria evolved as Fe(II) oxidation specialists. In all, studies suggest that Zetaproteobacteria are widespread, and therefore may have a broad influence on marine and saline terrestrial Fe cycling. © 2019 FEMS 2019.},

The results indicate substantial alteration of the planktonic microbial populations as applied raffinate solution chemistry changed, leading to the dominance of heterotrophic bacteria atypical of previously-described bioleach environments (predominantly Microbacterium and Achromobacter species), and an archaeal population completely dominated by Ferroplasma species. Inferred attached microbial populations from the single samples obtained near the end of the heap leach operation resembled populations more in line with past studies, containing Acidithiobacillus, Sulfobacillus, and Leptospirillum species, and archaeal populations containing Ferroplasma and Acidiplasma species.

	abstract = {Zetaproteobacteria create extensive iron (Fe) oxide mats at marine hydrothermal vents, making them an ideal model for microbial Fe oxidation at circumneutral pH. Comparison of neutrophilic Fe oxidizer isolate genomes has revealed a hypothetical Fe oxidation pathway, featuring a homolog of the Fe oxidase Cyc2 from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. However, Cyc2 function is not well verified in neutrophilic Fe oxidizers, particularly in Fe-oxidizing environments. Toward this, we analyzed genomes and metatranscriptomes of Zetaproteobacteria, using 53 new high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes reconstructed from Fe mats at Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Mariana Backarc, and Loihi Seamount (Hawaii) hydrothermal vents. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated conservation of Cyc2 sequences among most neutrophilic Fe oxidizers, suggesting a common function. We confirmed the widespread distribution of cyc2 and other model Fe oxidation pathway genes across all represented Zetaproteobacteria lineages. High expression of these genes was observed in diverse Zetaproteobacteria under multiple environmental conditions and in incubations. The putative Fe oxidase gene cyc2 was highly expressed in situ, often as the top expressed gene. The cyc2 gene showed increased expression in Fe(II)amended incubations, with corresponding increases in carbon fixation and central metabolism gene expression. These results substantiate the Cyc2-based Fe oxidation pathway in neutrophiles and demonstrate its significance in marine Fe-mineralizing environments. IMPORTANCE Iron oxides are important components of our soil, water supplies, and ecosystems, as they sequester nutrients, carbon, and metals. Microorganisms can form iron oxides, but it is unclear whether this is a significant mechanism in the environment. Unlike other major microbial energy metabolisms, there is no marker gene for iron oxidation, hindering our ability to track these microbes. Here, we investigate a promising possible iron oxidation gene, cyc2, in iron-rich hydrothermal vents, where iron-oxidizing microbes dominate. We pieced together diverse Zetaproteobacteria genomes, compared these genomes, and analyzed expression of cyc2 and other hypothetical iron oxidation genes. We show that cyc2 is widespread among iron oxidizers and is highly expressed and potentially regulated, making it a good marker for the capacity for iron oxidation and potentially a marker for activity. These findings will help us understand and potentially quantify the impacts of neutrophilic iron oxidizers in a wide variety of marine and terrestrial environments. © 2020 McAllister et al.},

	abstract = {[Objective] To investigate the adaptive mechanism of bioleaching microorganisms to extreme environment based on CRISPR system at the genomic level, bioinformatic analyses were performed on the structural characteristics and homology of CRISPR-Cas system in genomes of 100 species from genera (Acidithiobacillus, Desulfovibrio, Leptospirillum, Sulfobacillus, Acidiplasma and Ferroplasma) in acid mine environment. [Methods] We downloaded genome sequences from NCBI website and identified potential CRISPR arrays by using CRISPR Finder. The composition, structure and function of each CRISPR system were analyzed, where repeats were classified by Clustal Omega and spacers were aligned and annotated according to nr database, plasmid database and viral database, respectively. The CRISPR-Cas system of microorganisms in acid mine environment was classified based on the types and homology of Cas proteins. [Results] Among the genomes of 100 bioleaching microorganisms, we found 415 CRISPR arrays. There were 80 different repeats and 4147 spacers in 176 confirmed CRISPR arrays. All the 12 types of repeat sequences in each cluster could form typical RNA secondary structure and the sequence of cluster 10 was the most representative one among all the bioleaching microorganisms. The annotation results showed that these microorganisms have been attacked by bacterial plasmids and virus, and have resisted the invasion of foreign nucleic acid sequences through different defense mechanisms. Most of the CRISPR-Cas systems of bioleaching bacteria belong to I-C and I-E subtypes, while most of the CRISPR-Cas systems of archaea belong to I-D subtype. There are significant differences between them in the evolution process based on the CRISPR-Cas system. [Conclusion] The CRISPR structure of acid mine environment microorganisms may mediate the interaction between foreign nucleic acid sequence and Cas protein based on different immune mechanisms, which provides a foundation for further revealing the adaptive evolution mechanism of extreme environment microorganisms. © 2020, Acta Microbiologica Sinica Editorial Office.

	abstract = {Auricularia cornea is a widely cultivated edible fungus with substantial nutritive value. This study aimed to enrich the multifunctional bionutrient element selenium in A. cornea to improve its quality and explore the accumulation of selenium in the fungus using high-throughput RNA-Seq technology. In general, the treatment group with a 100 µg/g supply of selenium outperformed the other treatment groups in terms of high yield, rich crude polysaccharides and a high total selenium concentration. Additional evidences demonstrated the budding and mature phases were two typical growth stages of A. cornea and were important for the accumulation of selenium. Therefore, the budding and mature phase tissues of A. cornea in the treatment group with a 100 µg/g supply of selenium were used for transcriptome analysis and compared to those of a control group that lacked additional selenium. A total of 2.56 × 105 unigenes from A. cornea transcriptome were assembled and annotated to five frequently used databases including NR, GO, KEGG, eggNOG and SwissProt. GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in metabolic process and translation were up-expressed at the budding stage in response to selenium supplementation, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, ribosome. In addition, the differential gene expression patterns of A. cornea suggested that the up-expressed genes were more likely to be detected at the budding stage than at the mature stage. These results provide insights into the transcriptional response of A. cornea to selenium accumulation. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans is one of the most studied biomining species, highlighting its ability to oxidize reduced inorganic sulfur compounds, coupled with its elevated capacity to live under an elevated concentration of heavy metals. In this work, using an in silico semi-automatic genome scale approach, two biological networks for A. thiooxidans Licanantay were generated: (i) An affinity transcriptional regulatory network composed of 42 regulatory family genes and 1,501 operons (57% genome coverage) linked through 2,646 putative DNA binding sites (arcs), (ii) A metabolic network reconstruction made of 523 genes and 1,203 reactions (22 pathways related to biomining processes). Through the identification of confident connections between both networks (V-shapes), it was possible to identify a sub-network of transcriptional factor (34 regulators) regulating genes (61 operons) encoding for proteins involved in biomining-related pathways. Network analysis suggested that transcriptional regulation of biomining genes is organized into different modules. The topological parameters showed a high hierarchical organization by levels inside this network (14 layers), highlighting transcription factors CysB, LysR, and IHF as complex modules with high degree and number of controlled pathways. In addition, it was possible to identify transcription factor modules named primary regulators (not controlled by other regulators in the sub-network). Inside this group, CysB was the main module involved in gene regulation of several bioleaching processes. In particular, metabolic processes related to energy metabolism (such as sulfur metabolism) showed a complex integrated regulation, where different primary regulators controlled several genes. In contrast, pathways involved in iron homeostasis and oxidative stress damage are mainly regulated by unique primary regulators, conferring Licanantay an efficient, and specific metal resistance response. This work shows new evidence in terms of transcriptional regulation at a systems level and broadens the study of bioleaching in A. thiooxidans species. © Copyright © 2020 Cortés, Acuña, Travisany, Siegel, Maass and Latorre.},

	abstract = {We investigated bacterial and archaeal communities along an ice-fed surficial hot spring at Kverkfjöll volcano—a partially ice-covered basaltic volcano at Vatnajökull glacier, Iceland, using biomolecular (16S rRNA, apsA, mcrA, amoA, nifH genes) and stable isotope techniques. The hot spring environment is characterized by high temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentrations at the source (68°C and <1 mg/L (±0.1%)) changing to lower temperatures and higher dissolved oxygen downstream (34.7°C and 5.9 mg/L), with sulfate the dominant anion (225 mg/L at the source). Sediments are comprised of detrital basalt, low-temperature alteration phases and pyrite, with <0.4 wt. % total organic carbon (TOC). 16S rRNA gene profiles reveal that organisms affiliated with Hydrogenobaculum (54%–87% bacterial population) and Thermoproteales (35%–63% archaeal population) dominate the micro-oxic hot spring source, while sulfur-oxidizing archaea (Sulfolobales, 57%–82%), and putative sulfur-oxidizing and heterotrophic bacterial groups dominate oxic downstream environments. The δ13Corg (‰ V-PDB) values for sediment TOC and microbial biomass range from −9.4‰ at the spring's source decreasing to −12.6‰ downstream. A reverse effect isotope fractionation of ~3‰ between sediment sulfide (δ34S ~0‰) and dissolved water sulfate (δ34S +3.2‰), and δ18O values of ~ −5.3‰ suggest pyrite forms abiogenically from volcanic sulfide, followed by abiogenic and microbial oxidation.

	abstract = {The surfactant industry moves billions of dollars a year and consists of chemically synthesized molecules usually derived from petroleum. Surfactant is a versatile molecule that is widely used in different industrial areas, with an emphasis on the petroleum, biomedical and detergent industries. Recently, interest in environmentally friendly surfactants that are resistant to extreme conditions has increased because of consumers' appeal for sustainable products and industrial processes that often require these characteristics. With this context, the need arises to search for surfactants produced by microorganisms coming from extreme environments and to mine their unique biotechnological potential. The production of biosurfactants is still incipient and presents challenges regarding economic viability due to the high costs of cultivation, production, recovery and purification. Advances can be made by exploring the extreme biosphere and bioinformatics tools. This review focuses on biosurfactants produced by microorganisms from different extreme environments, presenting a complete overview of what information is available in the literature, including the advances, challenges and future perspectives, as well as showing the possible applications of extreme biosurfactants. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli MazF is a toxin protein that cleaves RNA at ACA sequences. Its activation has been thought to cause growth inhibition, primarily through indiscriminate cleavage of RNA. To investigate responses following MazF activation, transcriptomic profiles of mazF-overexpressing and non-overexpressing E. coli K12 cells were compared. Analyses of differentially expressed genes demonstrated that the presence and the number of ACA trimers in RNA was unrelated to cellular RNA levels. Mapping differentially expressed genes onto the chromosome identified two chromosomal segments in which upregulated genes formed clusters, and these segments were absent in the chromosomes of E. coli strains other than K12. These results suggest that MazF regulates selective, rather than indiscriminate, categories of genes, and is involved in the regulation of horizontally acquired genes. We conclude that the primary role of MazF is not only cleaving RNA indiscriminately but also generating a specific cellular state. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a bacterium that not only survives, but also thrives, proliferates, and remains infective at cold-storage temperatures, making it an adept foodborne pathogen. We analyzed the differences in gene expression between Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 grown at 3 and 28°C to investigate which genes were significantly more expressed at low temperature at different phases of growth. We isolated and sequenced the RNA from six distinct corresponding growth points at both temperatures to also outline the expression patterns of the differentially expressed genes. Genes involved in motility, chemotaxis, phosphotransferase systems (PTS), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of different nutrients such as fructose and mannose showed higher levels of transcripts at 3°C. At the beginning of growth, especially genes involved in securing nutrients, glycolysis, transcription, and translation were upregulated at 3°C. To thrive as well as it does at low temperature, Y. pseudotuberculosis seems to require certain cold shock proteins, especially those encoded by yptb3585, yptb3586, yptb2414, yptb2950, and yptb1423, and transcription factors, like Rho, IF-1, and RbfA, to maintain its protein synthesis. We also found that genes encoding RNA-helicases CsdA (yptb0468), RhlE (yptb1214), and DbpA (yptb1652), which unwind frozen secondary structures of nucleic acids with cold shock proteins, were significantly more expressed at 3°C, indicating that these RNA-helicases are important or even necessary during cold. Genes involved in excreting poisonous spermidine and acquiring compatible solute glycine betaine, by either uptake or biosynthesis, showed higher levels of transcripts at low temperatures. This is the first finding of a strong connection between the aforementioned genes and the cold adaptation of Y. pseudotuberculosis. Understanding the mechanisms behind the cold adaptation of Y. pseudotuberculosis is crucial for controlling its growth during cold storage of food, and will also shed light on microbial cold adaptation in general. © Copyright © 2018 Virtanen, Keto-Timonen, Jaakkola, Salin and Korkeala.},

	abstract = {Bioinformatics is a continuously evolving field since it came into existence and contributing significantly in all major areas of biological sciences. Advanced sequencing technologies and exponential growth in computational resources have facilitated the high-end bioinformatics application in various research areas such as microbiome research in biological system. Bioinformatics contributed significantly in the development of powerful methods and tools in metagenomics research through direct inspection of targeted and nontargeted DNA in environmental samples. Advances in metagenomics, high-throughput methods, tools, software, pipelines, databases and analysis products for the microbes and microbiome-related studies have shifted the field of microbiology from culturing and microscopy studies to DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. In the last decade, various long-term research projects and studies have flooded the microbiome sequencing data and analyses. Now, microbial community is realized that the next decade of microbial research will need data management, sharing, mining and networking skills to enhance knowledge discovery and regulation of microbial communities in ecosystem.

	abstract = {Ferruginous (Fe-rich, SO4-poor) conditions are generally restricted to freshwater sediments on Earth today, but were likely widespread during the Archean and Proterozoic Eons. Lake Towuti, Indonesia, is a large ferruginous lake that likely hosts geochemical processes analogous to those that operated in the ferruginous Archean ocean. The metabolic potential of microbial communities and related biogeochemical cycling under such conditions remain largely unknown. We combined geochemical measurements (pore water chemistry, sulfate reduction rates) with metagenomics to link metabolic potential with geochemical processes in the upper 50 cm of sediment. Microbial diversity and quantities of genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction (dsrAB) and methanogenesis (mcrA) decrease with increasing depth, as do rates of potential sulfate reduction. The presence of taxa affiliated with known iron- and sulfate-reducers implies potential use of ferric iron and sulfate as electron acceptors. Pore-water concentrations of acetate imply active production through fermentation. Fermentation likely provides substrates for respiration with iron and sulfate as electron donors and for methanogens that were detected throughout the core. The presence of ANME-1 16S and mcrA genes suggests potential for anaerobic methane oxidation. Overall our data suggest that microbial community metabolism in anoxic ferruginous sediments support coupled Fe, S and C biogeochemical cycling. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium, is well known for its mineral oxidizing properties. The current study combines experimental and whole genome sequencing approaches to investigate an iron oxidizing, extreme acidophilic bacterium, A. ferrooxidans isolate (IO-2C) from an acid seep area near Carlos, TX, USA. Strain IO-2C was capable of oxidizing iron i.e. iron sulphate and iron ammonium sulphate yielding shwertmannite and jarosite minerals. Further, the bacterium’s genome was sequenced, assembled and annotated to study its general features, structure and functions. To determine genetic heterogeneity, it was compared with the genomes of other published A. ferrooxidans strains. Pan-genome analysis displayed low gene conservation and significant genetic diversity in A. ferrooxidans species comprising of 6926 protein coding sequences with 23.04% (1596) core genes, 46.13% (3195) unique and 30.82% (2135) accessory genes. Variant analysis showed >75,000 variants, 287 of them with a predicted high impact, in A. ferrooxidans IO-2C genome compared to the reference strain, resulting in abandonment of some important functional key genes. The genome contains numerous functional genes for iron and sulphur metabolism, nitrogen fixation, secondary metabolites, degradation of aromatic compounds, and multidrug and heavy metal resistance. This study demonstrated the bio-oxidation of iron by newly isolated A. ferrooxidans IO-2C under acidic conditions, which was further supported by genomic analysis. Genomic analysis of this strain provided valuable information about the complement of genes responsible for the utilization of iron and tolerance of other metals. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The complicated relationships among environmental microorganisms are regulated by quorum sensing (QS). Understanding QS-based signals could shed light on the interactions between microbial communities in certain environments. Although QS characteristics have been widely discussed, few studies have been conducted on the role of QS in phycospheric microorganisms. Here, we used metagenomics to examine the profile of AI-1 (AinS, HdtS, LuxI) and AI-2 (LuxS) autoinducers from a deeply sequenced microbial database, obtained from a complete dinoflagellate bloom. A total of 3001 putative AI-1 homologs and 130 AI-2 homologs were identified. The predominant member among the AI groups was HdtS. The abundance of HdtS, AinS, and LuxS increased as the bloom developed, whereas the abundance of LuxI showed the opposite trend. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that HdtS and LuxI synthase originated mainly from alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria, whereas AinS synthase originated solely from Vibrionales. In comparison to AI-1, the sequences related to AI-2 (LuxS) demonstrated a much wider taxonomic coverage. Some significant correlations were found between dominant species and QS signals. In addition to the QS, we also performed parallel analysis of the quorum quenching (QQ) sequences. In comparison to QS, the relative abundance of QQ signals was lower; however, an obvious frequency correlation was observed. These results suggested that QS and QQ signals co-participate in regulating microbial communities during an algal bloom. These data helped to reveal the characteristic behavior of algal symbiotic bacteria, and facilitated a better understanding of microbial dynamics during an algal bloom event from a chemical ecological perspective. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {At least five gene clusters in the Geobacter sulfurreducens genome encode putative “electron conduits” implicated in electron transfer across the outer membrane, each containing a periplasmic multiheme c-type cytochrome, integral outer membrane anchor, and outer membrane redox lipoprotein(s). Markerless single-gene-cluster deletions and all possible multiple-deletion combinations were constructed and grown with soluble Fe(III) citrate, Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides, and graphite electrodes poised at 0.24 V and 0.1 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Different gene clusters were necessary for reduction of each electron acceptor. During metal oxide reduction, deletion of the previously described omcBC cluster caused defects, but deletion of additional components in an ΔomcBC background, such as extEFG, were needed to produce defects greater than 50% compared to findings with the wild type. Deletion of all five gene clusters abolished all metal reduction. During electrode reduction, only the ΔextABCD mutant had a severe growth defect at both redox potentials, while this mutation did not affect Fe(III) oxide, Mn(IV) oxide, or Fe(III) citrate reduction. Some mutants containing only one cluster were able to reduce particular terminal electron acceptors better than the wild type, suggesting routes for improvement by targeting specific electron transfer pathways. Transcriptomic comparisons between fumarate and electrode-based growth conditions showed all of these ext clusters to be constitutive, and transcriptional analysis of the triple-deletion strain containing only extABCD detected no significant changes in expression of genes encoding known redox proteins or pilus components. These genetic experiments reveal new outer membrane conduit complexes necessary for growth of G. sulfurreducens, depending on the available extracellular electron acceptor. IMPORTANCE Gram-negative metal-reducing bacteria utilize electron conduits, chains of redox proteins spanning the outer membrane, to transfer electrons to the extracellular surface. Only one pathway for electron transfer across the outer membrane of Geobacter sulfurreducens has been linked to Fe(III) reduction. However, G. sulfurreducens is able to respire a wide array of extracellular substrates. Here we present the first combinatorial genetic analysis of five different electron conduits via creation of new markerless deletion strains and complementation vectors. Multiple conduit gene clusters appear to have overlapping roles, including two that have never been linked to metal reduction. Another recently described cluster (ExtABCD) was the only electron conduit essential during electrode reduction, a substrate of special importance to biotechnological applications of this organism.

	abstract = {Industrial biomining processes are currently focused on metal sulfides and their dissolution, which is catalyzed by acidophilic iron(II)- and/or sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms. Cell attachment on metal sulfides is important for this process. Biofilm formation is necessary for seeding and persistence of the active microbial community in industrial biomining heaps and tank reactors, and it enhances metal release. In this study, we used a method for direct quantification of the mineral-attached cell population on pyrite or chalcopyrite particles in bioleaching experiments by coupling high-throughput, automated epifluorescence microscopy imaging of mineral particles with algorithms for image analysis and cell quantification, thus avoiding human bias in cell counting. The method was validated by quantifying cell attachment on pyrite and chalcopyrite surfaces with axenic cultures of Acidithiobacillus caldus, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans. The method confirmed the high affinity of L. ferriphilum cells to colonize pyrite and chalcopyrite surfaces and indicated that biofilm dispersal occurs in mature pyrite batch cultures of this species. Deep neural networks were also applied to analyze biofilms of different microbial consortia. Recent analysis of the L. ferriphilum genome revealed the presence of a diffusible soluble factor (DSF) family quorum sensing system. The respective signal compounds are known as biofilm dispersal agents. Biofilm dispersal was confirmed to occur in batch cultures of L. ferriphilum and S. thermosulfidooxidans upon the addition of DSF family signal compounds. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Members of the genus Bifidobacterium are found in a wide-range of habitats and are used as important probiotics. Thus, exploration of their functional traits at the genus level is of utmost significance. Besides, this genus has been demonstrated to exhibit an open pan-genome based on the limited number of genomes used in earlier studies. However, the number of genomes is a crucial factor for pan-genome calculations. We have analyzed the pan-genome of a comparatively larger dataset of 215 members of the genus Bifidobacterium belonging to different habitats, which revealed an open nature. The pan-genome for the 56 probiotic and human-gut strains of this genus, was also found to be open. The accessory-and unique-components of this pan-genome were found to be under the operation of Darwinian selection pressure. Further, their genome-size variation was predicted to be attributed to the abundance of certain functions carried by genomic islands, which are facilitated by insertion elements and prophages. In silico functional and host-microbe interaction analyses of their core-genome revealed significant genomic factors for niche-specific adaptations and probiotic traits. The core survival traits include stress tolerance, biofilm formation, nutrient transport, and Sec-secretion system, whereas the core probiotic traits are imparted by the factors involved in carbohydrate-and protein-metabolism and host-immunomodulations. © 2018, MDPI AG.

	abstract = {Soda lakes are saline alkaline lakes characterized by high concentrations of sodium carbonate/bicarbonate which lead to a stable elevated pH (>9), and moderate to extremely high salinity. Despite this combination of extreme conditions, biodiversity in soda lakes is high, and the presence of diverse microbial communities provides a driving force for highly active biogeochemical cycles. The sulfur cycle is one of the most important of these and bacterial sulfur oxidation is dominated by members of the obligately chemolithoautotrophic genus Thioalkalivibrio. Currently, 10 species have been described in this genus, but over one hundred isolates have been obtained from soda lake samples. The genomes of 75 strains were sequenced and annotated previously, and used in this study to provide a comprehensive picture of the diversity and distribution of genes related to dissimilatory sulfur metabolism in Thioalkalivibrio. Initially, all annotated genes in 75 Thioalkalivibrio genomes were placed in ortholog groups and filtered by bi-directional best BLAST analysis. Investigation of the ortholog groups containing genes related to sulfur oxidation showed that flavocytochrome c (fcc), the truncated sox system, and sulfite:quinone oxidoreductase (soe) are present in all strains, whereas dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsr; which catalyzes the oxidation of elemental sulfur) was found in only six strains. The heterodisulfide reductase system (hdr), which is proposed to oxidize sulfur to sulfite in strains lacking both dsr and soxCD, was detected in 73 genomes. Hierarchical clustering of strains based on sulfur gene repertoire correlated closely with previous phylogenomic analysis. The phylogenetic analysis of several sulfur oxidation genes showed a complex evolutionary history. All in all, this study presents a comprehensive investigation of sulfur metabolism-related genes in cultivated Thioalkalivibrio strains and provides several avenues for future research. © 2019 Berben, Overmars, Sorokin and Muyzer.},

	abstract = {Two Burkholderia spp. (strains SRS-25 and SRS-46) were isolated from high concentrations of uranium (U) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-managed Savannah River Site (SRS). SRS contains soil gradients that remain co-contaminated by heavy metals from previous nuclear weapons production activities. Uranium (U) is one of the dominant contaminants within the SRS impacted soils, which can be microbially transformed into less toxic forms. We established microcosms containing strains SRS-25 and SRS-46 spiked with U and evaluated the microbially-mediated depletion with concomitant genomic and proteomic analysis. Both strains showed a rapid depletion of U; draft genome sequences revealed SRS-25 genome to be of approximately 8,152,324 bp, a G + C content of 66.5, containing a total 7604 coding sequences with 77 total RNA genes. Similarly, strain SRS-46 contained a genome size of 8,587,429 bp with a G + C content of 67.1, 7895 coding sequences, with 73 total RNA genes, respectively. An in-depth, genome-wide comparisons between strains 25, 46 and a previously isolated strain from our research (Burkholderia sp. strain SRS-W-2-2016), revealed a common pool of 3128 genes; many were found to be homologues to previously characterized metal resistance genes (e.g., for cadmium, cobalt, and zinc), as well as for transporter, stress/detoxification, cytochromes, and drug resistance functions. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of strains with or without U stress, revealed the increased expression of 34 proteins from strain SRS-25 and 52 proteins from strain SRS-46; similar to the genomic analyses, many of these proteins have previously been shown to function in stress response, DNA repair, protein biosynthesis and metabolism. Overall, this comparative proteogenomics study confirms the repertoire of metabolic and stress response functions likely rendering the ecological competitiveness to the isolated strains for colonization and survival in the heavy metals contaminated SRS soil habitat. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {A novel Gram staining positive, aerobic bacterium NEAU-HV1T that exhibits antifungal activity against Exserohilum turcicum was isolated from a soil collected from Gama, Hadjer lamis, Chad. It was grown at 10–45◦C (optimum 30◦C), pH 5–10 (optimum pH 8), and 0–4% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain NEAU-HV1T was closely related to Sinomonas susongensis A31T (99.24% sequence similarity), Sinomonas humi MUSC 117T (98.76%), and Sinomonas albida LC13T (98.68%). The average nucleotide identity values between NEAU-HV1T and its most closely related species were 79.34−85.49%. The digital DNA–DNA hybridization values between NEAU-HV1T and S. susongensis A31T, S. albida LC13T, and S. humi MUSC 117T were 23.20, 23.50, and 22.80%, respectively, again indicating that they belonged to different taxa. The genomic DNA G+C content was 67.64 mol%. The whole cell sugars contained galactose, mannose, and rhamnose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and four glycolipids. The respiratory quinone system comprised MK-9(H2), MK-10(H2), and MK-8(H2). The major cellular fatty acids (>5%) were anteiso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0, C16:0, and iso-C15:0. Based on the polyphasic analysis, it is suggested that the strain NEAU-HV1T represents a novel species of the genus Sinomonas, for which the name Sinomonas gamaensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-HV1T (= DSM 104514T = CCTCC M 2017246T). © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Absorbance measurements on intact chemolithotrophic microorganisms that respire aerobically on soluble iron are described that used a novel integrating cavity absorption meter to eliminate the effects of light scattering on the experimental results. Steady state kinetic measurements on ferric iron production by intact cells revealed that the Michaelis Menten equation described the initial rates of product formation for at least 8 different chemolithotrophic microorganisms in 6 phyla distributed equally among the archaea and the Gram negative and Gram positive eubacteria. Cell-monitored turnover measurements during aerobic respiration on soluble iron by the same 12 intact microorganisms revealed six different patterns of iron-dependent absorbance changes, suggesting that there may be at least six different sets of prosthetic groups and biomolecules that can accomplish aerobic respiration on soluble iron. Detailed kinetic studies revealed that the 3-component iron respiratory chain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans functioned as an ensemble with a single macroscopic rate constant when the iron-reduced proteins were oxidized in the presence of excess molecular oxygen. The principal member of this 3-component system was a cupredoxin called rusticyanin that was present in the periplasm of At. ferrooxidans at an approximate concentration of 350 mg/mL, an observation that provides new insights into the crowded environments in the periplasms of Gram negative eubacteria that conduct electrons across their periplasm. The ability to conduct direct spectrophotometric measurements under noninvasive physiological conditions represents a new and powerful approach to examine the rates and extents of biological events in situ without disrupting the complexity of the live cellular environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We used next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the entire prokaryotic community to study the biodiversity of this poorly explored extreme environment. The correlation of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs)s presence with physicochemical variables showed that the system contains three distinct environments: the crater lagoon, the Upper Río Agrio, and the Salto del Agrio waterfall, a point located approximately 12 km down the origin of the river, after it emerges from the Caviahue lake. The prokaryotic community of the Copahue Volcano-Río Agrio system is mainly formed by acidic bacteria and archaea, such as Acidithiobacillus, Ferroplasma, and Leptospirillum, which have been isolated from similar environments around the world. These results support the idea of a ubiquitous acidic biodiversity; however, this highly interesting extreme environment also has apparently autochthonous species such as Sulfuriferula, Acidianus copahuensis, and strains of Acidibacillus and Alicyclobacillus. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Bacterial toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems play important roles in diverse cellular regulatory processes. Here, we characterize three putative type II TA candidates from Acetobacter pasteurianus and investigate the profile of type II TA systems in the genus Acetobacter. Based on the gene structure and activity detection, two-pairs loci were identified as the canonical hicAB and higAB TA systems, respectively, and DB34_01190–DB34_01195 as a putative new one without a canonical TA architecture. Physiologically, the expression of the three pairs conferred E. coli with additional plasmid maintenance and survival when under acetic acid stress. Chromosomal TA systems can be horizontally transferred within an ecological vinegar microbiota by co-option, and there was a tendency for toxin module loss. The antitoxin retention in the genome is suggested to have a broad role in bacterial physiology. Furthermore, A. pasteurianus strains, universally domesticated and used for industrial vinegar fermentation, showed a higher number of type II TA loci compared to the host-associated ones. The amount of TA loci per genome showed little positive relationship to insertion sequences, although its prevalence was species-associated, to the extent of even being strain-associated. The TA system is a candidate of studying the resistant mechanistic network, the TAs-dependent translatome affords a real-time profile to explore stress adaptation of A. pasteurianus, promoting industrial development. © 2019, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

	abstract = {To cope with toxic levels of H2S, the plant pathogens Xylella fastidiosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens employ the bigR operon to oxidize H2S into sulfite. The bigR operon is regulated by the transcriptional repressor BigR and it encodes a bifunctional sulfur transferase (ST) and sulfur dioxygenase (SDO) enzyme, Blh, required for H2S oxidation and bacterial growth under hypoxia. However, how Blh operates to enhance bacterial survival under hypoxia and how BigR is deactivated to derepress operon transcription is unknown. Here, we show that the ST and SDO activities of Blh are in vitro coupled and necessary to oxidize sulfide into sulfite, and that Blh is critical to maintain the oxygen flux during A. tumefaciens respiration when oxygen becomes limited to cells. We also show that H2S and polysulfides inactivate BigR leading to operon transcription. Moreover, we show that sulfite, which is produced by Blh in the ST and SDO reactions, is toxic to Citrus sinensis and that X. fastidiosa-infected plants accumulate sulfite and higher transcript levels of sulfite detoxification enzymes, suggesting that they are under sulfite stress. These results indicate that BigR acts as a sulfide sensor in the H2S oxidation mechanism that allows pathogens to colonize plant tissues where oxygen is a limiting factor. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Acinetobacter bereziniae is an environmental microorganism with increasing clinical incidence, and may thus provide a model for a bacterial species bridging the gap between the environment and the clinical setting. A. bereziniae plasmids have been poorly studied, and their characterization could offer clues on the causes underlying the leap between these two different habitats. Here we characterized the whole plasmid content of A. bereziniae HPC229, a clinical strain previously reported to harbor a 44-kbp plasmid, pNDM229, conferring carbapenem and aminoglycoside resistance. We identified five extra plasmids in HPC229 ranging from 114 to 1.3 kbp, including pAbe229-114 (114 kbp) encoding a MOBP111 relaxase and carrying heavy metal resistance, a bacteriophage defense BREX system and four different toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. Two other replicons, pAbe229-15 (15.4 kbp) and pAbe229-9 (9.1 kbp), both encoding MOBQ1 relaxases and also carrying TA systems, were found. The three latter plasmids contained Acinetobacter Rep_3 superfamily replication initiator protein genes, and functional analysis of their transfer regions revealed the mobilizable nature of them. HPC229 also harbors two smaller plasmids, pAbe229-4 (4.4 kbp) and pAbe229-1 (1.3 kbp), the former bearing a ColE1-type replicon and a TA system, and the latter lacking known replication functions. Comparative sequence analyses against deposited Acinetobacter genomes indicated that the above five HPC229 plasmids were unique, although some regions were also present in other of these genomes. The transfer, replication, and adaptive modules in pAbe229-15, and the stability module in pAbe229-9, were bordered by sites potentially recognized by XerC/XerD site-specific tyrosine recombinases, thus suggesting a potential mechanism for their acquisition. The presence of Rep_3 and ColE1-based replication modules, different mob genes, distinct adaptive functions including resistance to heavy metal and other environmental stressors, as well as antimicrobial resistance genes, and a high content of XerC/XerD sites among HPC229 plasmids provide evidence of substantial links with bacterial species derived from both environmental and clinical habitats. © 2019 Brovedan et al.

	abstract = {Microbial degradation of thiocyanate (SCN−) has been reported to suffer from instability highlighting the need for improved understanding of underlying mechanisms and boundaries. Respirometry, batch tests and DNA sequencing analysis were used to improve understanding of a mixed culture treating coke wastewater rich in SCN−. An uncultured species of Thiobacillus was the most abundant species (26%) and displayed similar metabolic capabilities to Thiobacillus denitrificans and Thiobacillus thioparus. Thiocyanate was hydrolysed/oxidised to NH4+-N, HCO3− and SO42−. Nevertheless, at 360–2100 mg SCN−/L a breakdown in the degradation pathway was observed. Respirometry tests demonstrated that NH4+-N was inhibitory to SCN− degradation (IC50: 316 mg/L). Likewise, phenol (180 mg/L) and hydroxylamine (0.25–16 mg/L) reduced SCN− degradation by 41% and ca. 7%, respectively. The understanding of the SCN− degradation pathways can enable stable treatment efficiencies and compliance with effluent of <4 mg SCN/L, required by the Industrial Emissions Directive. © 2019},

	abstract = {Understanding soil production of the trace gas carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is key to its use as a tracer of ecosystem function. Underlying its application is the observation that vascular plants consume atmospheric OCS via their stomatal pores in proportion with CO2 photosynthesis and that soil fluxes of OCS are negligible in comparison. Recent soil-centered studies demonstrate that soils can produce OCS and contribute as much as a quarter of the atmospheric terrestrial flux. Despite the potential widespread importance of soil OCS emissions, insufficient data exist to predict variations in OCS production across ecosystems, and the chemical and biological drivers of OCS production are virtually unknown. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by investigating variables controlling OCS soil production including soil physical and chemical properties, microbial community composition, and sulfur speciation in two independent surveys. We found that soil OCS production was nearly ubiquitous across the 58 sites, increased exponentially with temperature, and was insensitive to visible light conditioning. Soil pH, N, and C/N were predictors of OCS soil production rates in both soil surveys. Patterns in soil S speciation and predicted microbial S-cycling pathways both pointed to S-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine and their derivatives as potential precursors for OCS production. Elevated sulfate levels were associated with OCS production in some soils. This study provides new mechanistic insight into OCS production in soils and presents strategies to represent soil OCS fluxes that facilitate the use of OCS as a tracer for leaf-level processes related to carbon and water cycling. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {A new approach to microbial electrosynthesis is proposed, aimed at producing whole biomass from N2 and inorganic carbon, by electrostimulation of complex microbial communities. On a carbon-based conductor under constant polarization (−0.7 V vs SHE), an electroactive biofilm was enriched with autotrophic nitrogen fixing microorganims and led to biomass synthesis at higher amounts (up to 18 fold), as compared to controls kept at open circuit (OC). After 110 days, the electron transfer had increased by 30-fold, as compared to abiotic conditions. Metagenomics evidenced Nif genes associated with autotrophs (both Archaea and Bacteria) only in polarized biofilms, but not in OC. With this first proof of concept experiment, we propose to call this promising field ‘bioelectrochemical nitrogen fixation’ (e-BNF): a possible way to ‘power’ biological nitrogen fixation, organic carbon storage and soil fertility against desertification, and possibly a new tool to study the development of early prokaryotic life in extreme environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillaceae, an important family of acidophilic and chemoautotrophic sulfur or iron oxidizers, participate in geobiochemical circulation of the elements and drive the release of heavy metals in mining associated habitats. Because of their environmental adaptability and energy metabolic systems, Acidithiobacillus spp. have become the dominant bacteria used in bioleaching for heavy metal recovery. Flagella-driven motility is associated with bacterial chemotaxis and bacterial responses to environmental stimuli. However, little is known about how the flagellum of Acidithiobacillus spp. is regulated and how the flagellum affects the growth of these chemoautotrophic bacteria. In this study, we analyzed the flagellar gene clusters in Acidithiobacillus strains and uncovered the close relationship between flagella and the sulfur-oxidizing systems (Sox system). The σ28 gene (rpoF) knockout and overexpression strains of Acidithiobacillus caldus were constructed. Scanning electron microscopy shows that A. caldus ΔrpoF cells lacked flagella, indicating the essential role of RpoF in regulating flagella synthesis in these chemoautotrophic bacteria. Motility analysis suggests that the deletion of rpoF resulted in the reduction of swarming capability, while this capability was enhanced in the rpoF overexpression strain. Both static cultivation and low concentration of energy substrates (elemental sulfur or tetrathionate) led to weak growth of A. caldus ΔrpoF cells. The deletion of rpoF promoted bacterial attachment to the surface of elemental sulfur in static cultivation. The absence of RpoF caused an obvious change in transcription profile, including genes in flagellar cluster and those involved in biofilm formation. These results provide an understanding on the regulation of flagellar hierarchy and the flagellar function in these sulfur or iron oxidizers. © 2019 Yang, Chen, Wang, Lin, Liu, Pang, Zhang, Lin and Chen.

	abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD) is an environmental issue that can be characterized by either acidic or circumneutral pH and high dissolved metal content in contaminated waters. It is estimated to affect roughly 3000 miles of waterways within the state of Pennsylvania, with half being acidic and half being circumneutral. To negate the harmful effects of AMD, ∼300 passive remediation systems have been constructed within the state of Pennsylvania. In this study, we evaluated the microbial community structure and functional capability associated with Middle Branch passive remediation system in central PA. Sediment and water samples were collected from each area within the passive remediation system and its receiving stream. Environmental parameters associated with the remediation system were found to explain a significant amount of variation in microbial community structure. This study revealed shifts in microbial community structure from acidophilic bacteria in raw AMD discharge to a more metabolically diverse set of taxa (i.e., Acidimicrobiales, Rhizobiales, Chthoniobacteraceae) toward the end of the system. Vertical flow ponds and the aerobic wetland showed strong metabolic capability for sulfur redox environments. These findings are integral to the understanding of designing effective passive remediation systems because it provides insight as to how certain bacteria [sulfate reducing bacteria (SRBs) and sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOBs)] are potentially contributing to a microbially mediated AMD remediation process. This study further supports previous investigations that demonstrated the effectiveness of SRBs in the process of removing sulfate and heavy metals from contaminated water. © 2019 Ly, Wright, Weit, McLimans, Ulrich, Tokarev, Valkanas, Trun,.},

In this study, 52 proteobacteria genomes were analyzed for the presence of phosphorus acquisition genes, their pattern of arrangement and copy numbers. The diverse genetic architecture of the Pho regulon genes indicates the evolutionary challenge of nutrient limitation, particularly phosphorus, faced by bacteria in their environment. The incongruence between the Pho regulon proteins phylogeny and species phylogeny along with the presence of additional copies of pstS and pstB genes, having cross similarity with other genera, suggest the possibility of horizontal gene transfer event. The substitution rate analysis and multiple sequence alignment of the Pho regulon proteins were analyzed to gain additional insight into the evolution of the Pho regulon system. This comprehensive study confirms that genes perform the regulatory function (phoBR) were vertically inherited, whereas interestingly, genes whose product involved in direct interaction with the environment (pstS) acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The substantial amino acid substitutions in PstS most likely contribute to the successful adaptation of bacteria in different ecological condition dealing with different phosphorus availability. The findings decipher the intelligence of the bacteria which enable them to carry out the targeted alteration of genes to cope up with the environmental condition. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

It will be difficult to cover without inequality all the efforts, initiatives and works that have happened for the past two decades in this vast region (that includes >19 million km 2 and >600 million people). Despite the difficulty, we have done an analytical search looking for publications in the field made by researchers from 19 LA countries in the past 25 years. In this way, we find that research in bioinformatics in this region should develop twice to approach the average world scientific production in the field. We also found some of the pioneering scientists who initiated and led bioinformatics in the region and were promoters of this new scientific field. Our analysis also reveals that spin-off began around some specific areas within the biomolecular sciences: studies on genomes (anchored in the new generation of deep sequencing technologies, followed by developments in proteomics) and studies on protein structures (supported by three-dimensional structural determination technologies and their computational advancement). Finally, we show that the contribution to this endeavour of the Iberoamerican Society for Bioinformatics, founded in Mexico in 2009, has been significant, as it is a leading forum to join efforts of many scientists from LA interested in promoting research, training and education in bioinformatics. © 2017 The Author.

	abstract = {Soil acidification is accelerated by anthropogenic and agricultural activities, which could significantly affect global methane cycles. However, detailed knowledge of the genomic properties of methanotrophs adapted to acidic soils remains scarce. Using metagenomic approaches, we analyzed methane-utilizing communities enriched from acidic forest soils with pH 3 and 4, and recovered near-complete genomes of proteobacterial methanotrophs. Novel methanotroph genomes designated KS32 and KS41, belonging to two representative clades of methanotrophs (Methylocystis of Alphaproteobacteria and Methylobacter of Gammaproteobacteria), were dominant. Comparative genomic analysis revealed diverse systems of membrane transporters for ensuring pH homeostasis and defense against toxic chemicals. Various potassium transporter systems, sodium/proton antiporters, and two copies of proton-translocating F1F0-type ATP synthase genes were identified, which might participate in the key pH homeostasis mechanisms in KS32. In addition, the V-type ATP synthase and urea assimilation genes might be used for pH homeostasis in KS41. Genes involved in the modification of membranes by incorporation of cyclopropane fatty acids and hopanoid lipids might be used for reducing proton influx into cells. The two methanotroph genomes possess genes for elaborate heavy metal efflux pumping systems, possibly owing to increased heavy metal toxicity in acidic conditions. Phylogenies of key genes involved in acid adaptation, methane oxidation, and antiviral defense in KS41 were incongruent with that of 16S rRNA. Thus, the detailed analysis of the genome sequences provides new insights into the ecology of methanotrophs responding to soil acidification. © 2018 Nguyen, Yu, Gwak, Kim, Park, Herbold, Kim, Jung and Rhee.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of biological evolution and genetic mechanisms is gained by studying the adaptation of bacteria to survive in adverse environmental conditions. In this regard, transcriptomic profiling of a glyphosate-tolerant Enterobacter strain NRS-1 was studied under four different treatments to investigate the gene-regulatory system for glyphosate tolerance. A total of 83, 83, 60 and 74 genes were up-regulated and 108, 87, 178 and 117 genes down-regulated under 60-NPG, 110-NPG, NaCl (355 mM) and HCl (pH 4.46) stress treatments, respectively. Complex gene network was identified to be involved in regulating tolerance to glyphosate. This study revealed that NRS-1 has gained glyphosate tolerance at the cost of osmotic and acidic resistance. The 25 differentially expressed genes are reported to may have partly changed the function for providing resistance to glyphosate directly, among them genes metK, mtbK, fdnG and wzb that might detoxify/degrade the glyphosate. However, under 110-NPG condition, NRS-1 might have utilized economical and efficient ways by depressing its metabolism and activity to pass through this stress. Hence, the present study provides insights into the genes involved in glyphosate tolerance, which can be effectively utilized to engineer herbicide-resistant crop varieties after their proper validation to manage weed growth. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Olkiluoto, an island on the south-west coast of Finland, will host a deep geological repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel. Microbially induced corrosion from the generation of sulphide is therefore a concern as it could potentially compromise the longevity of the copper waste canisters. Groundwater at Olkiluoto is geochemically stratified with depth and elevated concentrations of sulphide are observed when sulphate-rich and methane-rich groundwaters mix. Particularly high sulphide is observed in methane-rich groundwater from a fracture at 530.6 mbsl, where mixing with sulphate-rich groundwater occurred as the result of an open drill hole connecting two different fractures at different depths. To determine the electron donors fuelling sulphidogenesis, we combined geochemical, isotopic, metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses. This revealed a low diversity microbial community fuelled by hydrogen and organic carbon. Sulphur and carbon isotopes of sulphate and dissolved inorganic carbon, respectively, confirmed that sulphate reduction was ongoing and that CO2 came from the degradation of organic matter. The results demonstrate the impact of introducing sulphate to a methane-rich groundwater with limited electron acceptors and provide insight into extant metabolisms in the terrestrial subsurface. © 2018 Bell, Lamminmäki, Alneberg, Andersson, Qian, Xiong, Hettich, Balmer, Frutschi, Sommer and Bernier-Latmani.},

We summarize this analysis in terms of TA locus, accession identifier, hits in conserved domain database, toxin superfamily, antitoxin superfamily and chromosomal/mobile genome/plasmid occurrences. Moreover, for TA context analyses we use six different specifications namely virulence factors, mobile genetic elements (MGE), antibiotic resistance genes, secretion systems, prophage and a classification of mobile genetic elements (ACLAME); among these hits are found for only MGE, ACLAME and prophage. A total 39 sets of TA have been discovered in which numbers of TA encoded for MGE, ACLAME and prophage are 15, 15 and 5 respectively while the remaining four have no context hit. In addition, a comparative analysis of TAome was also done with closely related bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1 (NCBI RefSeq NC_005126) and results shows that a total 8 sets of TA are conserved. Further, a bootstrap Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree was also constructed for major toxin protein superfamily found namely RelE, HigB, GNAT, CcdB and MazF explored in the TAome of X. nematophila. We also characterized, the most abundantly found TA module (relBE) in this TAome, functionally and transcriptionally. This first TAome analysis of type II TA modules provides new insights in multi-drug tolerance in bacterial populations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Geothermal springs are model ecosystems to investigate microbial biogeography as they represent discrete, relatively homogenous habitats, are distributed across multiple geographical scales, span broad geochemical gradients, and have reduced metazoan interactions. Here, we report the largest known consolidated study of geothermal ecosystems to determine factors that influence biogeographical patterns. We measured bacterial and archaeal community composition, 46 physicochemical parameters, and metadata from 925 geothermal springs across New Zealand (13.9–100.6 °C and pH < 1–9.7). We determined that diversity is primarily influenced by pH at temperatures <70 °C; with temperature only having a significant effect for values >70 °C. Further, community dissimilarity increases with geographic distance, with niche selection driving assembly at a localised scale. Surprisingly, two genera (Venenivibrio and Acidithiobacillus) dominated in both average relative abundance (11.2% and 11.1%, respectively) and prevalence (74.2% and 62.9%, respectively). These findings provide an unprecedented insight into ecological behaviour in geothermal springs, and a foundation to improve the characterisation of microbial biogeographical processes. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Enzymatic sugar coupling is a competitive technology for industrial glycosylation reactions, since chemical synthetic routes require extensive use of laborious protection group manipulations and often lack regio-and stereoselectivity. The application of Leloir glycosyltransferases has received considerable attention in recent years and offers excellent control over the reactivity and selectivity of glycosylation reactions with unprotected carbohydrates, paving the way for previously inaccessible synthetic routes. The development of nucleotide recycling cascades has allowed for the efficient production and reuse of nucleotide sugar donors in robust one-pot multi-enzyme glycosylation cascades. In this way, large glycans and glycoconjugates with complex stereochemistry can be constructed. With recent advances, LeLoir glycosyltransferases are close to being applied industrially in multi-enzyme, programmable cascade glycosylations. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cyclic and linear nucleotides are key elements of the signal transduction networks linking perception of the environment to specific cellular behavior of prokaryotes. These molecular mechanisms are particularly important in bacteria exposed to different, and frequently simultaneous, types of extreme conditions. This is the case in acidithiobacilli, a group of extremophilic bacteria thriving in highly acidic biotopes, that must also cope with significant variations in temperature, osmotic potentials and concentrations of various transition metals and metalloids. Environmental cues sensed by bacteria are transduced into differential levels of nucleotides acting as intracellular second messengers, promoting the activation or inhibition of target components and eliciting different output phenotypes. Cyclic (c) di-GMP, one of the most common bacterial second messengers, plays a key role in lifestyle changes in many bacteria, including acidithiobacilli. The presence of functional c-di-GMP-dependent signal transduction pathways in representative strains of the best-known linages of this species complex has been reported. However, a comprehensive panorama of the c-di-GMP modulated networks, the cognate input signals and output responses, are still missing for this group of extremophiles. Moreover, little fundamental understanding has been gathered for other nucleotides acting as second messengers. Taking advantage of the increasing number of sequenced genomes of the taxon, here we address the challenge of disentangling the nucleotide-driven signal transduction pathways in this group of polyextremophiles using comparative genomic tools and strategies. Results indicate that the acidithiobacilli possess all the genetic elements required to establish functional transduction pathways based in three different nucleotide-second messengers: (p)ppGpp, cyclic AMP (cAMP), and c-di-GMP. The elements related with the metabolism and transduction of (p)ppGpp and cAMP appear highly conserved, integrating signals related with nutrient starvation and polyphosphate metabolism, respectively. In contrast, c-di-GMP networks appear diverse and complex, differing both at the species and strain levels. Molecular elements of c-di-GMP metabolism and transduction were mostly found scattered along the flexible genome of the acidithiobacilli, allowing the identification of probable control modules that could be critical for substrate colonization, biofilm development and intercellular interactions. These may ultimately convey increased endurance to environmental stress and increased potential for gene sharing and adaptation to changing conditions. © 2019 Moya-Beltrán, Rojas-Villalobos, Díaz, Guiliani, Quatrini and Castro.

	abstract = {Microbial communities of iron-rich water in the Pyhäsalmi mine, Finland, were investigated with high-throughput amplicon sequencing and qPCR targeting bacteria, archaea, and fungi. In addition, the abundance of Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus was assessed with genus-specific qPCR assays, and enrichment cultures targeting aerobic ferrous iron oxidizers and ferric iron reducers were established. The acidic (pH 1.4-2.3) mine water collected from 240 m, 500 m, and 600 m depth from within the mine had a high microbial diversity consisting of 63-114 bacterial, 10-13 archaeal, and 104-117 fungal genera. The most abundant microorganisms in the mine water were typical acid mine drainage (AMD) taxa, such as acidophilic, iron-oxidizing Leptospirillum, Acidiphilum, Acidithiobacillus, Ferrovum, and Thermoplasma. The fungi belonged mostly to the phylum Ascomycetes, although a great part of the fungal sequences remained unclassified. The number of archaeal 16S rRNA genes in the mine water was between 0.3 and 1.2 × 10 copies mL-1 in the samples from 500 m and 600 m, but only 3.9 × 10 at 240 m and archaea were in general not enriched in cultures. The number of fungal 5.8S rRNA genes was high only in the mine water from 500 m and 600 m, where 0.2-3.4 × 104 spore equivalents mL-1 were detected. A high number of Leptospirillum 16S rRNA genes, 0.6-1.6 × 1010 copies mL-1, were detected at 500 m and 600 m depth and in cultures containing ferrous iron, showing the importance of iron oxidizers in this environment. The abundance of bacteria in general was between 10 and 106 16S rRNA gene copies mL-1. Our results showed a high microbial diversity in the acid- and iron-impacted waters of the Pyhäsalmi mine, where Leptospirillum bacteria were especially prominent. These iron oxidizers are also the main nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in this ecosystem. © 2019 Malin Bomberg et al.},

The time required in these operations is relatively large as different microorganisms take different amount of time in bioleaching or bio oxidation. Extensive research is going in the field of metallurgy and biotechnology to create new strains, by genetic manipulation, which give better yield and take shorter time. This is resulting in a lot of dispersed data around the globe at various locations in the form of literature hard copies and web material. Hence, we try is to create a freely accessible, informative and cumulated data repository of mining bacteria, from which the data related to any kind of mining microorganism can be extracted and any new data related to existing or new strains can be uploaded so that a uniform informational repository is formed. Since, the bacterial groups are the most researched groups amongst the plethora of mining microorganisms, we first aimed at creating a database for the bacterial group, which can further be extended to other groups as well. © RJPT All right reserved.},

	abstract = {No common, unique genetic markers applicable to classification and phylogenetics for significant genera within the Propionibacteriaceae family have been suggested yet. Therefore, the aim of the study was to propose those genes in the genera Acidipropionibacterium, Cutibacterium, Propionibacterium and Pseudopropionibacterium. These genera were recently elicited from the genus Propionibacterium through whole genomic analyses. Three housekeeping genes, glyS, infB and rplB, were selected from many others according to the requirements for appropriate classification/phylogenetic markers. Concrete fragments of the genes were amplified using specific primers in most of the type (14) and 11 wild strains (originating from dairy products, human skin and the crop of a laying hen) recently classified into the genus Propionibacterium. Sequences obtained from amplicons were used to perform gene statistics and phylogenetic analyses with respect to applicability in classification, typing and phylogeny. The 16S rRNA gene sequences, still considered relevant in spite of its proven shortcomings as a basic tool for evaluation of bacterial phylogeny, were used as a baseline for comparative analyses. The statistics of the gene sequences revealed that the variable regions of all three genes have higher resolution capabilities among strains examined compared to the 16S rRNA gene analysis. Phylogenetic analyses based on individual gene sequences and their concatenate enabled to distinguish clusters of species belonging to the genera Acidipropionibacterium, Cutibacterium and Propionibacterium, which corresponds with a recently reported genomic study. Thus, the crucial importance of this study is the economically advantageous classification and typing of propionibacterial isolates and strains through the three gene regions in contrast to the requirement for whole genomic assays. © 2018 IUMS.},

	abstract = {Rocky outcrops covered with thick Fe and Mn oxide coatings, which are known as ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts, are commonly found on slopes of aged seamounts in bathyal and abyssal zones. Although the presence of diverse microorganisms on these Fe-Mn crusts has been reported, little is known about their metabolism. Here, we report the metabolic potential of the microbial community in an abyssal crust collected in the Takuyo-Daigo Seamount, in the north-western Pacific. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the Fe-Mn crust, and detected putative genes involved in dissolution and precipitation of Fe and Mn, nitrification, sulfur oxidation, carbon fixation, and decomposition of organics in the metagenome. In addition, four metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of abundant members in the microbial community were recovered from the metagenome. The MAGs were affiliated with Thaumarchaeota, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, and were distantly related to previously reported genomes/MAGs of cultured and uncultured species. Putative genes involved in the above reactions were also found in the crust MAGs. Our results suggest that crust microbial communities play a role in biogeochemical cycling of C, N, S, Fe, and Mn, and imply that they contribute to the growth of Fe-Mn crusts. © 2019 Kato et al.

	abstract = {The Cheb Basin (CZ) is a shallow Neogene intracontinental basin filled with fluvial and lacustrine sediments that is located in the western part of the Eger Rift. The basin is situated in a seismically active area and is characterized by diffuse degassing of mantle-derived CO2 in mofette fields. The Hartoušov mofette field shows a daily CO2 flux of 23-97 tons of CO2 released over an area of 0.35 km2 and a soil gas concentration of up to 100% CO2. The present study aims to explore the geo-bio interactions provoked by the influence of elevated CO2 concentrations on the geochemistry and microbial community of soils and sediments. To sample the strata, two 3-m cores were recovered. One core stems from the center of the degassing structure, whereas the other core was taken 8 m from the ENE and served as an undisturbed reference site. The sites were compared regarding their geochemical features, microbial abundances, and microbial community structures. The mofette site is characterized by a low pH and high TOC/sulfate contents. Striking differences in the microbial community highlight the substantial impact of elevated CO2 concentrations and their associated side effects on microbial processes. The abundance of microbes did not show a typical decrease with depth, indicating that the uprising CO2-rich fluid provides sufficient substrate for chemolithoautotrophic anaerobic microorganisms. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes and multivariate statistics reveals that the pH strongly influences microbial composition and explains around 38.7% of the variance at the mofette site and 22.4% of the variance between the mofette site and the undisturbed reference site. Accordingly, acidophilic microorganisms (e.g., OTUs assigned to Acidobacteriaceae and Acidithiobacillus) displayed a much higher relative abundance at the mofette site than at the reference site. The microbial community at the mofette site is characterized by a high relative abundance of methanogens and taxa involved in sulfur cycling. The present study provides intriguing insights into microbial life and geo-bio interactions in an active seismic region dominated by emanating mantle-derived CO2-rich fluids, and thereby builds the basis for further studies, e.g., focusing on the functional repertoire of the communities. However, it remains open if the observed patterns can be generalized for different time-points or sites. © 2018 Frontiers Media S.A. All Rights Reserved.},

Herein, bioinformatics analysis revealed a metabolism shift in Rhodobacter capsulatus resulting from salt stress, with changes in gene expression allowing accumulation of compatible solutes to balance osmotic pressure, together with the up-regulation of the nitrogen fixation cycle, an electron sink of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. Using the transcriptome evidence of hindered electron transfer in the photosynthetic electron transport chain induced by adaption to salinity, increased understanding of photo-bioelectrocatalysis under salt stress is achieved. Accumulation of glycine-betaine allows immediate tuning of salinity tolerance but does not provide cell stabilization, with a 40 ± 20% loss of photo-bioelectrocatalysis in a 60 min time scale. Conversely, exposure to or inducing the expression of the Rhodobacter capsulatus gene transfer agent tunes salinity tolerance and increases cell stability.

	abstract = {                             Two annual Baltic Sea phytoplankton blooms occur in spring and summer. The bloom intensity is determined by nutrient concentrations in the water, while the period depends on weather conditions. During the course of the bloom, dead cells sink to the sediment where their degradation consumes oxygen to create hypoxic zones (< 2 mg/L dissolved oxygen). These zones prevent the establishment of benthic communities and may result in fish mortality. The aim of the study was to determine how the spring and autumn sediment chemistry and microbial community composition changed due to degradation of diatom or cyanobacterial biomass, respectively. Results from incubation of sediment cores showed some typical anaerobic microbial processes after biomass addition such as a decrease in NO                             2                             −                              + NO                             3                             −                              in the sediment surface (0–1 cm) and iron in the underlying layer (1–2 cm). In addition, an increase in NO                             2                             −                              + NO                             3                             −                              was observed in the overlying benthic water in all amended and control incubations. The combination of NO                             2                             −                              + NO                             3                             −                              diffusion plus nitrification could not account for this increase. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, the addition of cyanobacterial biomass during autumn caused a large increase in ferrous iron-oxidizing archaea while diatom biomass amendment during spring caused minor changes in the microbial community. Considering that OTUs sharing lineages with acidophilic microorganisms had a high relative abundance during autumn, it was suggested that specific niches developed in sediment microenvironments. These findings highlight the importance of nitrogen cycling and early microbial community changes in the sediment due to sinking phytoplankton before potential hypoxia occurs.                          © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A novel psychrotolerant Psychrobacillus strain PB01, isolated from an Antarctic iceberg, was comparatively analyzed with five related strains. The complete genome of strain PB01 consists of a single circular chromosome (4.3 Mb) and a plasmid (19 Kb). As potential low-temperature adaptation strategies, strain PB01 has four genes encoding cold-shock proteins, two genes encoding DEAD-box RNA helicases, and eight genes encoding transporters for glycine betaine, which can serve as a cryoprotectant, on the genome. The pan-genome structure of the six Psychrobacillus strains suggests that strain PB01 might have evolved to adapt to extreme environments by changing its genome content to gain higher capacity for DNA repair, translation, and membrane transport. Notably, strain PB01 possesses a complete TCA cycle consisting of eight enzymes as well as three additional Helicobacter pylori-type enzymes: ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase, succinyl-CoA/acetoacetyl-CoA transferase, and malate/quinone oxidoreductase. The co-existence of the genes for TCA cycle enzymes has also been identified in the other five Psychrobacillus strains. Copyright © 2020 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology},

	abstract = {Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing (QS) in the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) consortia has attracted increasing attention. However, AHL synthase in anammox bacteria and the relationship between AHL synthetic genes and anammox activity are still not clear because anammox bacteria have not been isolated from the consortia. Two novel synthases of AHLs (JqsI-1 and JqsI-2), which are HdtS-type rather than the widely studied LuxI-type, were identified in anammox bacteria Candidatus Jettenia caeni and synthesized four AHLs. There was a correlation between AHL concentration, in situ transcriptional expression of the AHL synthase genes (jqsI-1 and jqsI-2) and genetic marker of anammox activity (hydrazine synthase gene, hzsA). And AHL add-back studies demonstrated that AHL influence the expression of hzsA to regulate anammox bacterial activity.

	abstract = {Over decades many studies have focused on the biodegradation of microcystins (MCs), and some Mlr-dependent MC-degrading bacteria were recorded, but the ecological functions, metabolic traits, and potential evolution of these organisms remain poorly understood. In this study, 16S rRNA-based phylogeny unraveled a wide range of genetic diversity across bacterial lineage, accompanied by re-evaluation of taxonomic placement of some MC-degrading species. Genome-wide comparison showed that considerable genes unique in individual organisms were identified, suggesting genetic differentiation among these Mlr-dependent MC-degrading bacteria. Notably, analyses of metabolic profiles first revealed the presence of functional genes involved in phenylacetate biodegradation in the specialized genomic regions, and mlr gene cluster was located around the neighborhood. The identification of transposable elements further indicated that these genomic regions might undergo horizontal gene transfer events to recruit novel functionalities, suggesting an adaptive force driving genome evolution of these organisms. In short, phylogenetic and genetic content analyses of Mlr-dependent MC-degraders shed light on their metabolic potential, ecological roles, and bacterial evolution, and expand the understanding of ecological status of MCs biodegradation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Heavy metal pollution is one of the most widespread and complex environmental issues globally, posing a great threat to the ecosystem as well as human health. Bioremediation through heavy metal-resistant bacteria (HMRB) is currently the most promising technology to address this issue. To obtain HMRB to remediate heavy metal pollution potentially, 15 culturable HMRB strains were isolated from the sludge samples of an electroplating wastewater treatment plant (EWWTP), which belonged to the Bacillus, Shewanella, Lysinibacillus, and Acinetobacter genera. Their maximum tolerance concentrations to Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Cr2O7 2− were 40 mM, 10 mM, 200 mM, 40 mM, and 10 mM, respectively, and strain Mn1-4 showed much higher Mn2+ tolerance and removal effectiveness (3.355 g/L) than previously published reports. Moreover, multiple heavy metal-resistant genotypes and phenotypes were identified among these strains, of which strain Co1-1 carried the most of resistant gene sequences (10) and exhibited resistance to 7 categories of heavy metals, and the co-occurrence of heavy metal and antibiotic resistance were clearly observed in strain Ni1-3. In addition, flanked insert sequence (IS) elements on the heavy metal resistant genes (HMRGs) suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events may have resulted in multiple heavy metal resistance phenotypes and genotypes in these strains, and IS982 family transposase was presumed to result in the high Ni2+ tolerance in strain Ni1-3. This study expands our understanding of bacterial heavy metal resistance and provides promising candidates for heavy metal bioremediation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters play important roles in electron transfer, metabolic and biosynthetic reactions, and the regulation of gene expression. Understanding the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters is therefore relevant to many fields. In the complex process of Fe-S protein formation, the A-type assembly protein (ATAP) family, which consists of several subfamilies, plays an essential role in Fe-S cluster formation and transfer and is highly conserved across the tree of life. However, the taxonomic distribution, motif compositions, and the evolutionary history of the ATAP subfamilies are not well understood. To address these problems, our study investigated the taxonomic distribution of 321 species from a broad cross-section of taxa. Then, we identified common and specific motifs in multiple ATAP subfamilies to explain the functional conservation and nonredundancy of the ATAPs, and a novel, essential motif was found in Eumetazoa IscA1, which has a newly found magnetic function. Finally, we used phylogenetic analytical methods to reconstruct the evolution history of this family. Our results show that two types of ErpA proteins (nonproteobacteria-type ErpA1 and proteobacteria-type ErpA2) exist in bacteria. The ATAP family, consisting of seven subfamilies, can be further classified into two types of ATAPs. Type-I ATAPs include IscA, SufA, HesB, ErpA1, and IscA1, with an ErpA1-like gene as their last common ancestor, whereas type-II ATAPs consist of ErpA2 and IscA2, duplicated from an ErpA2-like gene. During the mitochondrial endosymbiosis, IscA became IscA1 in eukaryotes and ErpA2 became IscA2 in eukaryotes, respectively. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {At low oxygen concentrations, respiration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and other bacteria relies on activity of cytochrome cbb3 oxidases. A diheme cytochrome c4 (cyt c4) donates electrons to Pa cbb3 oxidases to enable oxygen reduction and proton pumping by these enzymes. Given the importance of this redox pathway for bacterial pathogenesis, both cyt c4 and cbb3 oxidase are potential targets for new antibacterial strategies. The structural information about these two proteins, however, is scarce, and functional insights for Pa and other bacteria have been primarily drawn from analyses of the analogous system from Pseudomonas stutzeri (Ps). Herein, we describe characterization of structural and redox properties of cyt c4 from Pa. The crystal structure of Pa cyt c4 has revealed that this protein is organized in two monoheme domains. The interdomain interface is more hydrophobic in Pa cyt c4, and the protein surface does not show the dipolar distribution of charges found in Ps cyt c4. The reduction potentials of the two hemes are similar in Pa cyt c4 but differ by about 100 mV in Ps cyt c4. Analyses of structural models of these and other cyt c4 proteins suggest that multiple factors contribute to the potential difference of the two hemes in these proteins, including solvent accessibility of the heme group, the distribution of surface charges, and the nature of the interdomain interface. The distinct properties of cyt c4 proteins from closely-related Pa and Ps bacteria emphasize the importance of examining the cbb3/cyt c4 redox pathway in multiple species. © 2019},

	abstract = {The diversity of microbial cells is reflected in differences in cell size and shape, motility, mechanisms of cell division, pathogenicity or adaptation to different environmental niches. All these variations are achieved by the distinct metabolic strategies adopted by the organisms. The respiratory chains are integral parts of those strategies especially because they perform the most or, at least, most efficient energy conservation in the cell. Respiratory chains are composed of several membrane proteins, which perform a stepwise oxidation of metabolites toward the reduction of terminal electron acceptors. Many of these membrane proteins use the energy released from the oxidoreduction reaction they catalyze to translocate charges across the membrane and thus contribute to the establishment of the membrane potential, i.e. they conserve energy. In this work we illustrate and discuss the composition of the respiratory chains of different taxonomic clades, based on bioinformatic analyses and on biochemical data available in the literature. We explore the diversity of the respiratory chains of Animals, Plants, Fungi and Protists kingdoms as well as of Prokaryotes, including Bacteria and Archaea. The prokaryotic phyla studied in this work are Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Chlamydiae, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus, Aquificae, Thermotogae, Deferribacteres, Nitrospirae, Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The Borbollones showed a temperature surrounding 60 °C, a pH of 2.4 and the gas released has a composition of ~ 97% CO                             2                             , ~ 0.07% H                             2                             S, ~ 2.3% N                             2                              and ~ 0.12% CH                             4                             . Other chemical species such as sulfate and iron were found at high levels with respect to typical fresh water bodies. Analysis by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding revealed that in Borbollones predominates an archaeon from the order Thermoplasmatales and one bacterium from the genus Sulfurimonas. Other sulfur- (genera Thiomonas, Acidithiobacillus, Sulfuriferula, and Sulfuricurvum) and iron-oxidizing bacteria (genera Sideroxydans, Gallionella, and Ferrovum) were identified.

	abstract = {Mining and processing of metal sulfide ores produces waters containing metals and inorganic sulfur compounds such as tetrathionate and thiosulfate. If released untreated, these sulfur compounds can be oxidized to generate highly acidic wastewaters [termed 'acid mine drainage (AMD)'] that cause severe environmental pollution. One potential method to remediate mining wastewaters is the maturing biotechnology of 'microbial fuel cells' that offers the sustainable removal of acid generating inorganic sulfur compounds alongside producing an electrical current. Microbial fuel cells exploit the ability of bacterial cells to transfer electrons to a mineral as the terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration by replacing the mineral with a solid anode. In consequence, by substituting natural minerals with electrodes, microbial fuel cells also provide an excellent platform to understand environmental microbe-mineral interactions that are fundamental to element cycling. Previously, tetrathionate degradation coupled to the generation of an electrical current has been demonstrated and here we report a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbial community. Reconstruction of inorganic sulfur compound metabolism suggested the substrate tetrathionate was metabolized by the Ferroplasma-like and Acidithiobacillus-like populations via multiple pathways. Characterized Ferroplasma species do not utilize inorganic sulfur compounds, suggesting a novel Ferroplasma-like population had been selected. Oxidation of intermediate sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and adenylyl-sulfate released electrons and the extracellular electron transfer to the anode was suggested to be dominated by candidate soluble electron shuttles produced by the Ferroplasma-like population. However, as the soluble electron shuttle compounds also have alternative functions within the cell, it cannot be ruled out that acidophiles use novel, uncharacterized mechanisms to mediate extracellular electron transfer. Several populations within the community were suggested to metabolize intermediate inorganic sulfur compounds by multiple pathways, which highlights the potential for mutualistic or symbiotic relationships. This study provided the genetic base for acidophilic microbial fuel cells utilized for the remediation of inorganic sulfur compounds from AMD.

Our review sheds light on the progress made for the individual steps towards these goals, starting with the discovery of new enzymes and their corresponding genes. The enzymes are subsequently engineered to improve their performance, combined in reaction cascades to expand the reaction scope and integrated in whole cells to provide an optimal environment for the bioconversion. Strain engineering using synthetic biology methods tunes the host for production, reaction design optimizes the reaction conditions and downstream processing ensures the efficient recovery of commercially viable products. Selected examples illustrate how modified enzymes can revolutionize future-oriented applications ranging from the bioproduction of bulk-, specialty- and fine chemicals, active pharmaceutical ingredients and carbohydrates, over the conversion of the greenhouse-gas CO2 into valuable products and biocontrol in agriculture, to recycling of synthetic polymers and recovery of precious metals. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study surveyed physicochemical properties and bacterial community structure of water and sediments from an acid mine drainage (AMD) dam in South Africa. High-throughput sequence analysis revealed low diversity bacterial communities affiliated within 8 dominant phyla; Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria, Saccharibacteria, and ca. TM6_(Dependentiae). Acidiphilium spp. which are common AMD inhabitants but rarely occur as dominant taxa, were the most abundant in both AMD water and sediments. Other groups making up the community are less common AMD inhabitants; Acidibacillus, Acidibacter, Acidobacterium, Acidothermus, Legionella, Metallibacterium, Mycobacterium, as well as elusive taxa (Saccharibacteria, ca. TM6_(Dependentiae) and ca. JG37-AG-4). Although most of the taxa are shared between sediment and water communities, alpha diversity indices indicate a higher species richness in the sediments. From canonical correspondence analysis, DOC, Mn, Cu, Cr, Al, Fe, Ca were identified as important determinants of community structure in water, compared to DOC, Ca, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mg, K, Mn, Al, sulfates, and nitrates in sediments. Predictive functional profiling recovered genes associated with bacterial growth and those related to survival and adaptation to the harsh environmental conditions. Overall, the study reports on a distinct AMD bacterial community and highlights sediments as microhabitats with higher species richness than water. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

Environments characterised by low pH values, such as volcanic areas, are of particular interest for the search of acidophilic microorganisms with application in biotechnological processes. In this work, sulfate-reducing microorganisms were investigated in geothermal acidic, anaerobic zones from GCC system. Sediment samples from Agua del Limón (AL1), Las Máquinas (LMa2), Las Maquinitas (LMi) and Baño 9 (B9-2, B9-3) were found to be acidic (pH values 2.1-3.0) to moderate acidic (5.1-5.2), containing small total organic carbon values, and ferric iron precipitates. The organic electron donor added to the enrichment was completely oxidised to CO2. Bacteria related to 'Desulfobacillus acidavidus' strain CL4 were found to be dominant (67-83% of the total number of clones) in the enrichment cultures, and their presence was confirmed by their isolation on overlay plates. Other bacteria were also detected with lower abundance (6-20% of the total number of clones), with representatives of the genera Acidithiobacillus, Sulfobacillus, Alicyclobacillus and Athalassotoga/Mesoaciditoga. These enrichment and isolates found at low pH confirm the presence of anaerobic activities in the acidic sediments from the geothermal Copahue-Caviahue system. © 2019 FEMS.},

	abstract = {Exposure to gaseous ammonia, even at low levels, can be harmful to pigs and human health. However, less is known about the effects of sustained exposure to gaseous ammonia on nasal microbiota colonization in growing pigs. A total of 120 Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire pigs were housed in 24 separate chambers and continuously exposed to gaseous ammonia at 0,5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 ppm (four groups per exposure level) for 4 weeks. Then, we used high-throughput sequencing to perform 16S rRNA gene analysis in nasal swabs samples from 72 pigs (n = 12). The results of the nasal microbiota analysis showed that an increase in ammonia concentration, especially at 20 and 25 ppm, decreased the alpha diversity and relative abundance of nasal microbiota. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the most abundant phyla. In addition, the relative abundances of 24 microbial genera significantly changed as the ammonia level increased. Four microbial genera (Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Bacteroides) were significantly decreased at 25 ppm, while only two genera (Moraxella and Streptococcus) were increased at 25 ppm. PICRUSt analyses showed that the relative abundances of the nasal microbiota involved in cell motility, signal transduction, the nervous system, environmental adaptation, and energy and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly decreased, while genes involved in the immune system, endocrine system, circulatory system, immune system diseases and metabolism of vitamins, lipid, and amino acids were increased with increased ammonia levels. The results of in vivo tests showed that an increase in ammonia levels, especially an ammonia level of 25 ppm, caused respiratory tract injury and increase the number of Moraxella and Streptococcus species, while simultaneously decreasing respiratory immunity and growth performance, consistent with the increased presence of harmful bacteria identified by nasal microbiota analysis. Herein, this study also indicted that the threshold concentration of ammonia in pig farming is 20 ppm. Copyright © 2019 Wang, He, Yao, Shao, Li and Huang.

	abstract = {The development of multidrug- and toxin-resistant bacteria as a result of increasing industrialization and sustained and intense antimicrobial use in aquaculture results in human health problems through increased incidence of food-borne illnesses. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are self-transmissible mobile genetic elements that allow bacteria to acquire complex new traits through horizontal gene transfer and encode a wide variety of genetic information, including resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals; however, there is a lack of studies of ICEs of environmental origin in Asia. Here, we determined the prevalence, genotypes, heavy metal resistance and antimicrobial susceptibility of 997 presumptive strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (tlh+, tdh-), a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gastrointestinal illness in humans, isolated from four species of aquaculture shrimp in Jiangsu, China. We found that 59 of the 997 isolates (5.9%) were ICE-positive, and of these, 9 isolates tested positive for all resistance genes. BLAST analysis showed that similarity for the eight strains to V. parahaemolyticus was 99%. Tracing the V. parahaemolyticus genotypes, showed no significant relevance of genotype among the antimicrobial resistance strains bearing the ICEs or not. Thus, in aquaculture, ICEs are not the major transmission mediators of resistance to antibiotics or heavy metals. We suggest future research to elucidate mechanisms that drive transmission of resistance determinants in V. parahaemolyticus. Copyright © 2019 He, Wang, Zhang, Zhang, Sun, He and Liu.

	abstract = {                             The multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) protein family is a newly discovered family of secondary transporters that extrude metabolic waste and a variety of antibiotics out of the cell using an electrochemical gradient of H                             +                              or Na                             +                              across the membrane. The main function of MATE gene family is to participate in the process of plant detoxification and morphogenesis. The genome-wide analysis of the MATE genes in potato genome was conducted. At least 48 genes were initially identified and classified into six subfamilies. The chromosomal localization of MATE gene family showed that they could be distributed on 11 chromosomes except chromosome 9. The number of amino acids is 145–616, the molecular weight of proteins is 15.96–66.13 KD, the isoelectric point is 4.97–9.17, and they were located on the endoplasmic reticulum with having 4–13 transmembrane segments. They contain only two parts of the exons and UTR without introns. Some members of the first subfamily of potato MATE gene family are clustered with At2g04070 and they may be related to the transport of toxic compounds such as alkaloids and heavy metal. The function of the members of the second subfamily may be similar to that of At3g23560, which is related to tetramethylammonium transport. Some members of the third subfamily are clustered with At3g59030 and they may be involved in the transport of flavonoids. The fifth subfamily may be related to the transport of iron ions. The function of the sixth subfamily may be similar to that of At4g39030, which is related to salicylic acid transport. There are three kinds of conserved motifs in potato MATE genes, including the motif 1, motif 2, and motif 3. Each motif has 50 amino acids. The number of each motif is different in the gene sequence, of which 45 MATE genes contain at least a motif, but there is no motif in ST0015301, ST0045283, and ST0082336. These results provide a reference for further research on the function of potato MATE genes.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {This study was motivated by surprising gaps in the current knowledge of microbial inorganic carbon (Ci) uptake and assimilation at acidic pH values (pH < 3). Particularly striking is the limited understanding of the differences between Ci uptake mechanisms in acidic versus circumneutral environments where the Ci predominantly occurs either as a dissolved gas (CO2) or as bicarbonate (HCO3-), respectively. In order to gain initial traction on the problem, the relative abundance of transcripts encoding proteins involved in Ci uptake and assimilation was studied in the autotrophic, polyextreme acidophile Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans whose optimum pH for growth is 2.5 using ferrous iron as an energy source, although they are able to grow at pH 5 when using sulfur as an energy source. The relative abundance of transcripts of five operons (cbb1-5) and one gene cluster (can-sulP) was monitored by RT-qPCR and, in selected cases, at the protein level by Western blotting, when cells were grown under different regimens of CO2 concentration in elemental sulfur. Of particular note was the absence of a classical bicarbonate uptake system in A. ferrooxidans. However, bioinformatic approaches predict that sulP, previously annotated as a sulfate transporter, is a novel type of bicarbonate transporter. A conceptual model of CO2 fixation was constructed from combined bioinformatic and experimental approaches that suggests strategies for providing ecological flexibility under changing concentrations of CO2 and provides a portal to elucidating Ci uptake and regulation in acidic conditions. The results could advance the understanding of industrial bioleaching processes to recover metals such as copper at acidic pH. In addition, they may also shed light on how chemolithoautotrophic acidophiles influence the nutrient and energy balance in naturally occurring low pH environments. © 2019 Esparza, Jedlicki, González, Dopson and Holmes.

	abstract = {The order Lactobacillales represents a morphologically, metabolically, and physiologically diverse group of bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria represent the core of this phylogenetic group. They are a part of epiphytic microflora, fermented dairy, meat, fruit and vegetable products, and the digestive tract of humans and animals. Despite the fact that these bacteria form a phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous group, their phylogenetic relationship enables to propose a common genetic marker usable in classification, typing, and phylogeny. By creation of consensus sequence based on available genomic sequences of some representatives of order Lactobacillales, a specific primer-pair binding variable region of aspS gene (length of 615 nts) encoding the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was designed. This gene has not yet been used in classification and phylogeny of the order Lactobacillales, although it meets the requirements of molecular markers (distribution and single copy in bacterial genomes, functional constancy and genetic stability, sequence variability among taxonomic units, irreplaceable role in proteosynthesis). Primers were applied on 54 type and wild Lactobacillales strains. Obtained sequences allowed to provide alignments for purpose of phylogenetic tree reconstructions that uncovered particular phylogenetic clusters of vagococci/enterococci, obligately homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli. Although a relatively short fragment of the aspS gene (approximately 33% of the complete gene sequence) was evaluated, much higher sequence variability (61.8% of pairwise identity) among strains examined compared with 16S rRNA gene (90.7%, length of 1318 nt) provides a relatively simple and effective tool for classification and typing of selected representatives of the order Lactobacillales. © 2018, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.},

	abstract = {There are few naturally occurring environments where both acid and salinity stress exist together, consequently, there has been little evolutionary pressure for microorganisms to develop systems that enable them to deal with both stresses simultaneously. Members of the genus Acidihalobacter are iron- and sulfur-oxidizing, halotolerant acidophiles that have developed the ability to tolerate acid and saline stress and, therefore, have the potential to bioleach ores with brackish or saline process waters under acidic conditions. The genus consists of four members, A. prosperus DSM 5130T, A. prosperus DSM 14174, A. prosperus F5 and "A. ferrooxidans" DSM 14175. An in depth genome comparison was undertaken in order to provide a more comprehensive description of the mechanisms of halotolerance used by the different members of this genus. Pangenome analysis identified 29, 3 and 9 protein families related to halotolerance in the core, dispensable and unique genomes, respectively. The genes for halotolerance showed Ka/Ks ratios between 0 and 0.2, confirming that they are conserved and stabilized. All the Acidihalobacter genomes contained similar genes for the synthesis and transport of ectoine, which was recently found to be the dominant osmoprotectant in A. prosperus DSM 14174 and A. prosperus DSM 5130T. Similarities also existed in genes encoding low affinity potassium pumps, however, A. prosperus DSM 14174 was also found to contain genes encoding high affinity potassium pumps. Furthermore, only A. prosperus DSM 5130T and "A. ferrooxidans" DSM 14175 contained genes allowing the uptake of taurine as an osmoprotectant. Variations were also seen in genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis and/or transport of periplasmic glucans, sucrose, proline, and glycine betaine. This suggests that versatility exists in the Acidihalobacter genus in terms of the mechanisms they can use for halotolerance.

	abstract = {Members of the genus Acidithiobacillus, which can adapt to extremely high concentrations of heavy metals, are universally found at acid mine drainage (AMD) sites. Here, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 37 strains within the genus Acidithiobacillus to answer the untouched questions as to the mechanisms and the evolutionary history of metal resistance genes in Acidithiobacillus spp. The results showed that the evolutionary history of metal resistance genes in Acidithioba-cillus spp. involved a combination of gene gains and losses, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and gene duplication. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that metal resistance genes in Acidithiobacillus spp. were acquired by early HGT events from species that shared habitats with Acidithiobacillus spp., such as Acidihalobacter, Thiobacillus, Acidi-ferrobacter, and Thiomonas species. Multicopper oxidase genes involved in copper detoxification were lost in iron-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus ferridurans, Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and were replaced by rusticyanin genes during evolution. In addition, widespread purifying selection and the predicted high expression levels emphasized the indispensable roles of metal resistance genes in the ability of Acidithiobacillus spp. to adapt to harsh environments. Altogether, the results suggested that Acidithiobacillus spp. recruited and consolidated additional novel functionalities during the adaption to challenging environments via HGT, gene duplication, and purifying selection. This study sheds light on the distribution, organization, functionality, and complex evolutionary history of metal resistance genes in Acidithiobacillus spp. © 2019.

	abstract = {Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is a major global food-borne pathogen and causes life-threatening infections. Although the resistance mechanisms to fluoroquinolones in S. Typhimurium had been well-defined, tolerance to fluoroquinolones and the associated mechanism for this are obscure. In the current work, we investigated an oqxAB-positive plasmid pHXY0908 and analyzed its role in S. Typhimurium tolerance to ciprofloxacin using time-kill, transcriptome sequencing and real-time PCR. S. Typhimurium ATCC14028 could survive under lethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin after acquiring plasmid pHXY0908. Transcriptome sequence analysis showed the chromosomal genes were systematically regulated after acquiring this plasmid suggesting an interaction between chromosome and plasmid. Additionally, the chromosomal efflux pump genes acrB, acrA, tolC, and yceE were up-regulated after acquiring plasmid pHXY0908 suggesting that these efflux pumps may contribute to the survival of ATCC14028 exposed to the lethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, this is the first known report demonstrating that an IncHI2 type plasmid harboring oqxAB could assist S. Typhimurium survival under lethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin. © 2019 Lian, Wang, Liu, Xia, Fang, Sun, Liao and Liu.},

	abstract = {Microbial consortia execute collaborative molecular processes with contributions from individual species, on such basis enabling optimized molecular function. Such collaboration and synergies benefit metabolic flux specifically in extreme environmental conditions as seen in acid mine drainage, with biofilms as relevant microenvironment. However, knowledge about community species composition is not sufficient for deducing presence and efficiency of composite molecular function. For this task molecular resolution of the consortium interactome is to be retrieved, with molecular biomarkers particularly suited for characterizing composite molecular processes involved in biofilm formation and maintenance. A microbial species set identified in 18 copper environmental sites provides a data matrix for deriving a cross-species molecular process model of biofilm formation composed of 191 protein coding genes contributed from 25 microbial species. Computing degree and stress centrality of biofilm molecular process nodes allows selection of network hubs and central connectors, with the top ranking molecular features proposed as biomarker candidates for characterizing biofilm homeostasis. Functional classes represented in the biomarker panel include quorum sensing, chemotaxis, motility and extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis, complemented by chaperones. Abundance of biomarker candidates identified in experimental data sets monitoring different biofilm conditions provides evidence for the selected biomarkers as sensitive and specific molecular process proxies for capturing biofilm microenvironments. Topological criteria of process networks covering an aggregate function of interest support the selection of biomarker candidates independent of specific community species composition. Such panels promise efficient screening of environmental samples for presence of microbial community composite molecular function. © 2018 Bosse et al.

	abstract = {Multi functionalities linked with the microbial communities associated with the millet crop rhizosphere has remained unexplored. In this study, we are analyzing microbial communities inhabiting rhizosphere of kodo millet and their associated functions and its impact over plant growth and survival. Metagenomics of Paspalum scrobiculatum L.(kodo millet) rhizopshere revealed taxonomic communities with functional capabilities linked to support growth and development of the plants under nutrient-deprived, semi-arid and dry biotic conditions. Among 65 taxonomically diverse phyla identified in the rhizobiome, Actinobacteria were the most abundant followed by the Proteobacteria. Functions identified for different genes/proteins led to revelations that multifunctional rhizobiome performs several metabolic functions including carbon fixation, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, iron and aromatic compound metabolism, stress response, secondary metabolite synthesis and virulence, disease, and defense. Abundance of genes linked with N, P, S, Fe and aromatic compound metabolism and phytohormone synthesis—along with other prominent functions—clearly justifies growth, development, and survival of the plants under nutrient deprived dry environment conditions. The dominance of actinobacteria, the known antibiotic producing communities shows that the kodo rhizobiome possesses metabolic capabilities to defend themselves against biotic stresses. The study opens avenues to revisit multi-functionalities of the crop rhizosphere for establishing link between taxonomic abundance and targeted functions that help plant growth and development in stressed and nutrient deprived soil conditions. It further helps in understanding the role of rhizosphere microbiome in adaptation and survival of plants in harsh abiotic conditions. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Industrial thiocyanate (SCN−) waste streams from gold mining and coal coking have polluted environments worldwide. Modern SCN− bioremediation involves use of complex engineered heterotrophic microbiomes; little attention has been given to the ability of a simple environmental autotrophic microbiome to biodegrade SCN−. Here we present results from a bioreactor experiment inoculated with SCN− -loaded mine tailings, incubated autotrophically, and subjected to a range of environmentally relevant conditions. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed that SCN− hydrolase-encoding, sulphur-oxidizing autotrophic bacteria mediated SCN− degradation. These microbes supported metabolically-dependent non-SCN--degrading sulphur-oxidizing autotrophs and non-sulphur oxidizing heterotrophs, and “niche” microbiomes developed spatially (planktonic versus sessile) and temporally (across changing environmental parameters). Bioreactor microbiome structures changed significantly with increasing temperature, shifting from Thiobacilli to a novel SCN− hydrolase-encoding gammaproteobacteria. Transformation of carbonyl sulphide (COS), a key intermediate in global biogeochemical sulphur cycling, was mediated by plasmid-hosted CS2 and COS hydrolase genes associated with Thiobacillus, revealing a potential for horizontal transfer of this function. Our work shows that simple native autotrophic microbiomes from mine tailings can be employed for SCN− bioremediation, thus improving the recycling of ore processing waters and reducing the hydrological footprint of mining. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Organisms that thrive in extremely acidic environments (≤pH 3.5) are of widespread importance in industrial applications, environmental issues, and evolutionary studies. Leptospirillum spp. constitute the only extremely acidophilic microbes in the phylogenetically deep-rooted bacterial phylum Nitrospirae. Leptospirilli are Gram-negative, obligatory chemolithoautotrophic, aerobic, ferrous iron oxidizers. This paper predicts genes that Leptospirilli use to survive at low pH and infers their evolutionary trajectory. Phylogenetic and other bioinformatic approaches suggest that these genes can be classified into (i) “first line of defense”, involved in the prevention of the entry of protons into the cell, and (ii) neutralization or expulsion of protons that enter the cell. The first line of defense includes potassium transporters, predicted to form an inside positive membrane potential, spermidines, hopanoids, and Slps (starvation-inducible outer membrane proteins). The “second line of defense“ includes proton pumps and enzymes that consume protons. Maximum parsimony, clustering methods, and gene alignments are used to infer the evolutionary trajectory that potentially enabled the ancestral Leptospirillum to transition from a postulated circum-neutral pH environment to an extremely acidic one. The hypothesized trajectory includes gene gains/loss events driven extensively by horizontal gene transfer, gene duplications, gene mutations, and genomic rearrangements. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Interactions among microbial community members can lead to emergent properties, such as enhanced productivity, stability, and robustness. Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2–4), high-temperature (> 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected in situ with in silico calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (Metallosphaera yellowstonensis) and heterotroph (Geoarchaeum sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. In situ geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with in situ measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization. © 2018 Hunt et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.},

	abstract = {Electrotrophs are microbes that can receive electrons directly from cathode in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). They not only participate in organic biosynthesis, but also be crucial in cathode-based bioremediation. However, little is known about the electrotrophic community in paddy soils. Here, the putative electrotrophs were enriched by cathodes of MECs constructed from five paddy soils with various properties using bicarbonate as an electron acceptor, and identified by 16S rRNA-gene based Illumina sequencing. The electrons were gradually consumed on the cathodes, and 25%–45% of which were recovered to reduce bicarbonate to acetic acid during MEC operation. Firmicutes was the dominant bacterial phylum on the cathodes, and Bacillus genus within this phylum was greatly enriched and was the most abundant population among the detected putative electrotrophs for almost all soils. Furthermore, several other members of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria may also participate in electrotrophic process in different soils. Soil pH, amorphous iron and electrical conductivity significantly influenced the putative electrotrophic bacterial community, which explained about 33.5% of the community structural variation. This study provides a basis for understanding the microbial diversity of putative electrotrophs in paddy soils, and highlights the importance of soil properties in shaping the community of putative electrotrophs. © 2019},

C25 triggers Acidiphilium sp. C61 aggregation by producing the infochemical 2-phenethylamine (PEA). Here, we showed slightly enhanced aggregate formation in the presence of PEA on different Acidiphilium spp. but not other iron-snow microorganisms, including Acidocella sp. C78 and Ferrovum sp. PN-J47. Next, we sequenced the Acidiphilium sp. C61 genome to reconstruct its metabolic potential. Pangenome analyses of Acidiphilium spp. genomes revealed the core genome contained 65 gene clusters associated with aggregation, including autoaggregation, motility, and biofilm formation. Screening the Acidiphilium sp. C61 genome revealed the presence of autotransporter, flagellar, and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production genes. RNA-seq analyses of Acidiphilium sp. C61 incubations (+/− 10 μM PEA) indicated genes involved in energy production, respiration, and genetic processing were the most upregulated differentially expressed genes in the presence of PEA. Additionally, genes involved in flagellar basal body synthesis were highly upregulated, whereas the expression pattern of biofilm formation-related genes was inconclusive. Our data shows aggregation is a common trait among Acidiphilium spp. and PEA stimulates the central cellular metabolism, potentially advantageous in aggregates rapidly falling through the water column. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cadmium is a heavy metal present in contaminated soils. It has no biological role but when entering cells generates DNA damage, overexpression of stress response proteins and misfolded proteins, amongst other deleterious effects. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophilic bacterium resisting high concentrations of heavy metals such as cadmium. This is important for industrial bioleaching processes where Cd+2 concentrations can be 5–100 mM. Cadmium resistance mechanisms in these microorganisms have not been fully characterized. A. ferrooxidans ATCC 53993 contains genes coding for possible metal resistance determinants such as efflux systems: P-type ATPases, RND transporters and cation diffusion facilitators. In addition, it has extra copies of these genes in its exclusive genomic island (GI). Several of these putative genes were characterized in the present report by determining their transcriptional expression profiles and functionality. Moreover, an iTRAQ proteomic analysis was carried out to explore new cadmium resistance determinants in this bacterium. Changes in iron oxidation components, upregulation of transport proteins and variations in ribosomal protein levels were seen. Finally, increased concentrations of exclusive putative cadmium ATPases present in strain ATCC 53993 GI and other non-identified proteins such as Lferr_0210, forming part of a possible operon, could explain its extreme cadmium resistance. Significance: Cadmium is a very toxic heavy metal present in mining operations and contaminated environments, it can affect all living organisms, including humans. Therefore, it is important to know the resistance mechanisms of bacteria highly resistant to this metal. These microorganisms in turn, can be used to bioremediate more efficiently environments highly polluted with metals. The results obtained suggest A. ferrooxidans strain ATCC 53993 can be an efficient bacterium to remove cadmium, copper and other metals from contaminated sites. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Iron is a micronutrient for nearly all life on Earth. It can be used as an electron donor and electron acceptor by iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing microorganisms and is used in a variety of biological processes, including photosynthesis and respiration. While it is the fourth most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust, iron is often limiting for growth in oxic environments because it is readily oxidized and precipitated. Much of our understanding of how microorganisms compete for and utilize iron is based on laboratory experiments. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing and surge in publicly available sequence data has made it possible to probe the structure and function of microbial communities in the environment. To bridge the gap between our understanding of iron acquisition, iron redox cycling, iron storage, and magnetosome formation in model microorganisms and the plethora of sequence data available from environmental studies, we have created a comprehensive database of hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on genes related to iron acquisition, storage, and reduction/oxidation in Bacteria and Archaea. Along with this database, we present FeGenie, a bioinformatics tool that accepts genome and metagenome assemblies as input and uses our comprehensive HMM database to annotate provided datasets with respect to iron-related genes and gene neighborhood. An important contribution of this tool is the efficient identification of genes involved in iron oxidation and dissimilatory iron reduction, which have been largely overlooked by standard annotation pipelines. We validated FeGenie against a selected set of 28 isolate genomes and showcase its utility in exploring iron genes present in 27 metagenomes, 4 isolate genomes from human oral biofilms, and 17 genomes from candidate organisms, including members of the candidate phyla radiation. We show that FeGenie accurately identifies iron genes in isolates. Furthermore, analysis of metagenomes using FeGenie demonstrates that the iron gene repertoire and abundance of each environment is correlated with iron richness. While this tool will not replace the reliability of culture-dependent analyses of microbial physiology, it provides reliable predictions derived from the most up-to-date genetic markers. FeGenie’s database will be maintained and continually updated as new genes are discovered.

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans is an acidophilic chemolithoautotrophic bacterium widely used in the mining industry due to its metabolic sulfur-oxidizing capability. The biooxidation of sulfide minerals is enhanced through the attachment of At. thiooxidans cells to the mineral surface. The Type IV pili (TfP) of At. thiooxidans may play an important role in the bacteria attachment since TfP play a key adhesive role in the attachment and colonization of different surfaces. In this work, we report for the first time the mRNA sequence of three TfP proteins from At. thiooxidans, the adhesin protein PilY1 and the TfP pilins PilW and PilV. The nucleotide sequences of these TfP proteins show changes in some nucleotide positions with respect to the corresponding annotated sequences. The bioinformatic analyses and 3D-modeling of protein structures sustain their classification as TfP proteins, as structural homologs of the corresponding proteins of Ps. aeruginosa, results that sustain the role of PilY1, PilW and PilV in pili assembly. Also, that PilY1 comprises the conserved Neisseria-PilC (superfamily) domain of the tip-associated adhesin, while PilW of the superfamily of putative TfP assembly proteins and PilV belongs to the superfamily of TfP assembly protein. In addition, the analyses suggested the presence of specific functional domains involved in adhesion, energy transduction and signaling functions. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PilY1 of Acidithiobacillus genus forms a cohesive group linked with iron- and/or sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms from acid mine drainage or mine tailings. © 2019 Alfaro-Saldaña et al.

	abstract = {                             Chemoautotrophic bacteria belonging to the genus Sulfurimonas (class Campylobacteria) were previously identified as key players in the turnover of zero-valence sulfur, a central intermediate in the marine sulfur cycle. S. denitrificans was further shown to be able to oxidize cyclooctasulfur (S                             8                             ). However, at present the mechanism of activation and metabolism of cyclooctasulfur is not known. Here, we assessed the transcriptome and proteome of S. denitrificans grown with either thiosulfate or S                             8                              as the electron donor. While the overall expression profiles under the two growth conditions were rather similar, distinct differences were observed that could be attributed to the utilization of S                             8                             . This included a higher abundance of expressed genes related to surface attachment in the presence of S                             8                             , and the differential regulation of the sulfur-oxidation multienzyme complex (SOX), which in S. denitrificans is encoded in two gene clusters: soxABXY                             1                             Z                             1                              and soxCDY                             2                             Z                             2                             . While the proteins of both clusters were present with thiosulfate, only proteins of the soxCDY                             2                             Z                             2                              were detected at significant levels with S                             8                             .

	abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter exhibiting pivotal functions in diverse biological processes, including activation of multiple cardioprotective pathways. Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) is an integral membrane flavoprotein that catalyzes the first step in the mitochondrial metabolism of H2S. As such, it plays a critical role in controlling physiological levels of the gasotransmitter and has attracted keen interest as a potential drug target. We report the crystal structure of human SQOR, unraveling the molecular basis for the enzyme's ability to catalyze sulfane sulfur transfer reactions with structurally diverse acceptors. We demonstrate that human SQOR contains unique features: an electropositive surface depression implicated as a binding site for sulfane sulfur acceptors and postulated to funnel negatively charged substrates to a hydrophilic H2S-oxidizing active site, which is connected to a hydrophobic internal tunnel that binds coenzyme Q. These findings support a proposed model for catalysis and open the door for structure-based drug design. Jackson et al. determine the structure of human SQOR, a monotopic mitochondrial membrane protein that regulates physiological levels of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide. The structure uncovers the basis for the enzyme's ability to catalyze sulfane sulfur transfer reactions with structurally diverse acceptors and opens the door for structure-based drug design. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

To advance our knowledge of eukaryotic microorganisms and the factors that structure their communities, high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize their diversity and spatial distribution along the pollution gradient of the acid mine drainage at Carnoulès (France). A total of 16,510 reads were retrieved leading to the identification of 323 OTUs after normalization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a quite diverse eukaryotic community characterized by a total of eight high-level lineages including 37 classes. The majority of sequences were clustered in four main groups: Fungi, Stramenopiles, Alveolata and Viridiplantae. The Reigous sediments formed a succession of distinct ecosystems hosting contrasted eukaryotic communities whose structure appeared to be at least partially correlated with sediment mineralogy. The concentration of arsenic in the sediment was shown to be a significant factor driving the eukaryotic community structure along this continuum. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Friendly environmental hydrometallurgy at low temperatures is principally promoted by Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans. Until recently, the synergy between cold tolerance and the molecular mechanism of ferrous iron (Fe2+) oxidation was unknown. In the present paper, we conducted a physiological and comparative genomics analysis of the new strain A. ferrivorans PQ33 to elucidate the oxidation mechanism at low temperatures, with emphasis placed on trehalose and the Rus operon. PQ33 exhibited a doubling time of 66.6 h in Fe2+ at pH 1.6 and 63.6 h in CuS at 5 °C. Genomic island (GI) identification and comparative genome analysis were performed with four available genomes of Acidithiobacillus sp. The genome comprised 3,298,172 bp and 56.55% GC content. In contrast to ATCC Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strains, the genome of A. ferrivorans PQ33 harbors one GI, which contains a RusB gene. Moreover, five genes of peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (PPIases) were observed. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the trehalose operon suggested the presence of a horizontal transfer event. In addition, comparison of rusticyanin proteins revealed that RusB has better intrinsic flexibility than RusA. This comparison suggests psychrotolerant fitness and supports the genetic canalization of A. ferrivorans PQ33 for oxidation at low temperature. © 2017 Institut Pasteur},

	abstract = {Several studies have suggested the existence of a close relationship between antibiotic-resistant phenotypes and resistance to other toxic compounds such as heavy metals, which involve co-resistance or cross-resistance mechanisms. A metagenomic library was previously constructed in Escherichia coli with DNA extracted from the bacterial community inhabiting an acid mine drainage (AMD) site highly contaminated with heavy metals. Here, we conducted a search for genes involved in antibiotic resistance using this previously constructed library. In particular, resistance to antibiotics was observed among five clones carrying four different loci originating from CARN5 and CARN2, two genomes reconstructed from the metagenomic data. Among the three CARN2 loci, two carry genes homologous to those previously proposed to be involved in antibiotic resistance. The third CARN2 locus carries a gene encoding a membrane transporter with an unknown function and was found to confer bacterial resistance to rifampicin, gentamycin, and kanamycin. The genome of Thiomonas delicata DSM 16361 and Thiomonas sp. X19 were sequenced in this study. Homologs of genes carried on these three CARN2 loci were found in these genomes, two of these loci were found in genomic islands. Together, these findings confirm that AMD environments contaminated with several toxic metals also constitute habitats for bacteria that function as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

	abstract = {Sulfur Cave (Puturosu Mountain, Romania) is an extreme environment, unique for displaying life in a gas chemocline. The lower part of the cave is filled with CO2, CH4, and H2S of mofettic origin, while the upper part contains air that floats above the heavier volcanic gasses. S° and H2SO4 (from sulfur-oxidation) cover the cave wall at and below the CO2-H2S:O2 gas/gas interface. On the cave wall, near the interface the pH is <1 and unusual microbial biofilms occur on the rock’s surface. We provide context information on the geology, mineralogy, chemistry and biology to better understand this unique environment. We have used X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with EDAX capabilities, stable isotope analysis and 16S and 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The most common taxa in the microbial biofilms are Mycobacteria, Acidithiobacillus and Ferroplasmaceae. Liquid water in this system originates solely from condensation of water vapor onto the cave walls making inflow of organic carbon from outside unlikely. The most likely primary source of energy for this microbial community is sulfur oxidation with H2S and S° as main reductants and atmospheric O2 as the main oxidant. Ferric iron from the rock surface is another potential oxidant. In Sulfur Cave, gaseous CO2 (from mofettic emission) maintains the stability of the gas chemocline. Sulfur Cave biofilms can help the search for extreme life in the subsurface, near volcanic systems on Earth and Mars. The Sulfur Cave example shows that a habitable environment can be established underground in gas chemoclines near CO2-dominated gas discharge zones, where it can have a steady supply of water and energy. © 2018, Societa Speleologica Italiana.

	abstract = {This study describes the physiological properties of the widespread and recently described acid-tolerant microorganism Metallibacterium scheffleri DKE6. Despite that casitone was reported to be the only growth substrate of the organism, using a combination of proteomic, genomic and transcriptomic approaches as well as microbiological assays, we could identify a rather versatile metabolism. The detected casein hydrolysis was corroborated by the detection of proteases in the supernatant of the organism as well as in transcriptome studies. Genomic analysis identified amino acid auxotrophies, which were revealed as the reason for the observed growth deficiency with other substrates in the absence of casein. It was verified that glucose could serve as a growth substrate in the presence of amino acids as building blocks, a finding that was supported by the detection of three glycolytic pathways. Additionally, genes for sulfur and hydrogen oxidation were found, and sulfate formation could be shown during growth with tetrathionate. Metallibacterium scheffleri is able to raise the pH in acidic environments via ammonium production. Overall, the distribution of related Metallibacterium species demonstrates an adaption of this genus to diverse environments with varying pH values. Growth in biofilms or sediments also seems to be a common trait. We hypothesize that this biofilm growth supports the ability of Metallibacterium species to adapt to different pH values via formation of pH microniches.  © 2017 FEMS 2017. All rights reserved.

	abstract = {The iron-oxidizing species Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans is one of few acidophiles able to oxidize ferrous iron and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds at low temperatures (< 10°C). To complete the genome of At. ferrivorans strain CF27, new sequences were generated, and an update assembly and functional annotation were undertaken, followed by a comparative analysis with other Acidithiobacillus species whose genomes are publically available. The At. ferrivorans CF27 genome comprises a 3,409,655 bp chromosome and a 46,453 bp plasmid. At. ferrivorans CF27 possesses genes allowing its adaptation to cold, metal(loid)-rich environments, as well as others that enable it to sense environmental changes, allowing At. ferrivorans CF27 to escape hostile conditions and to move toward favorable locations. Interestingly, the genome of At. ferrivorans CF27 exhibits a large number of genomic islands (mostly containing genes of unknown function), suggesting that a large number of genes has been acquired by horizontal gene transfer over time. Furthermore, several genes specific to At. ferrivorans CF27 have been identified that could be responsible for the phenotypic differences of this strain compared to other Acidithiobacillus species. Most genes located inside At. ferrivorans CF27-specific gene clusters which have been analyzed were expressed by both ferrous iron-grown and sulfur-attached cells, indicating that they are not pseudogenes and may play a role in both situations. Analysis of the taxonomic composition of genomes of the Acidithiobacillia infers that they are chimeric in nature, supporting the premise that they belong to a particular taxonomic class, distinct to other proteobacterial subgroups. © 2017 Tran, Mangenot, Magdelenat, Payen, Rouy, Belahbib, Grail, Johnson, Bonnefoy and Talla.},

	abstract = {Bathycoccus is a cosmopolitan green micro-alga belonging to the Mamiellophyceae, a class of picophytoplankton that contains important contributors to oceanic primary production. A single species of Bathycoccus has been described while the existence of two ecotypes has been proposed based on metagenomic data. A genome is available for one strain corresponding to the described phenotype. We report a second genome assembly obtained by a single cell genomics approach corresponding to the second ecotype. The two Bathycoccus genomes are divergent enough to be unambiguously distinguishable in whole DNA metagenomic data although they possess identical sequence of the 18S rRNA gene including in the V9 region. Analysis of 122 global ocean whole DNA metagenome samples from the Tara-Oceans expedition reveals that populations of Bathycoccus that were previously identified by 18S rRNA V9 metabarcodes are only composed of these two genomes. Bathycoccus is relatively abundant and widely distributed in nutrient rich waters. The two genomes rarely co-occur and occupy distinct oceanic niches in particular with respect to depth. Metatranscriptomic data provide evidence for gain or loss of highly expressed genes in some samples, suggesting that the gene repertoire is modulated by environmental conditions. © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Acetobacterpasteurianus, an acetic acid resistant bacterium belonging to alpha-proteobacteria, has been widely used to produce vinegar in the food industry. To understand the mechanism of its high tolerance to acetic acid and robust ability of oxidizing ethanol to acetic acid (> 12%, w/v), we described the 3.1 Mb complete genome sequence (including 0.28 M plasmid sequence) with a G+C content of 52.4% of A. pasteurianus Ab3, which was isolated from the traditional Chinese rice vinegar (Meiguichu) fermentation process. Automatic annotation of the complete genome revealed 2,786 protein-coding genes and 73 RNA genes. The comparative genome analysis among A. pasteurianus strains revealed that A. pasteurianus Ab3 possesses many unique genes potentially involved in acetic acid resistance mechanisms. In particular, two-component systems or toxin-antitoxin systems may be the signal pathway and modulatory network in A. pasteurianus to cope with acid stress. In addition, the large numbers of unique transport systems may also be related to its acid resistance capacity and cell fitness. Our results provide new clues to understanding the underlying mechanisms of acetic acid resistance in Acetobacter species and guiding industrial strain breeding for vinegar fermentation processes. © 2016 Xia et al.

	abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway. © 2018 Aite et al.},

	abstract = {It is estimated that ~30% of a proteome binds to metal ion(s) for accomplishing its catalytic activities and structural complexities. Although metals are essential for the survival of a cell, they show cytotoxicity below or above a threshold concentration. In addition, toxic heavy metals, such as mercury and arsenic, present in the environment pose a higher level of toxicity to cells once inhaled, especially in humans. Thus, cells persistently produce a large number of metal-binding proteins to regulate the concentration and to detoxify the effect of toxic heavy metal ions inside the cell. Hence, for several years, metal-binding proteins, mostly from bacteria and plants, have been exploited for the bioremediation of water and land sites polluted by toxic heavy metals generally produced as by-products from various types of industries. Thus, the identification, characterization, and understanding of the molecular interaction(s) of metalloproteins with their cognate metal ions become necessary to design novel proteins/peptides to specifically chelate toxic heavy metals that could be used for bioremediation purposes. In this chapter, the aim is to describe and explore the existing knowledge of metal-binding proteins and peptides from different domains of life, which can be used for the bioremediation of heavy metal ions from the environment. It summarizes the structural view of the existing knowledge about various metal-binding proteins from different organisms in the prospect of bioremediation of toxic metals. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {16S rRNA gene profiling using a pipeline involving the Greengenes database revealed that bacterial populations in innermost (proximal to the steel surface) and outer regions of biofilms on carbon steel exposed 3 m below the surface at an offshore site in the Gulf of Guinea differed from one another and from seawater. There was a preponderance of gammaproteobacterial sequences, representing organisms known for hydrocarbon degradation. Total DNA from the innermost layer was 1500 times that recovered from the outermost. Stramenopiles (diatom) sequences were prevalent in the former. Rhodobacteriaceae, key biofilm formers, comprised 14.9% and 4.22% OTUs of inner and outer layers, respectively. Photosynthetic anaerobic sulfur oxidizer sequences were also prominent in the biofilms. Analysis of data using a different pipeline with Silva111 allowed detection of 0.3–0.4% SRB in the biofilms. The high abundance of aerobic micro-algal sequences in inner biofilm suggests they are initial colonizers of carbon steel surfaces in a marine environment. This is the first time that the microbial population of the strongly attached inner layer of the biofilm on steel has been differentiated from the outer, readily removed layer. The accepted scraping removal method is obviously inadequate and the resulting microbial analysis does not offer complete information on the biofilm community structure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Elemental sulfur (So) can serve as an electron donor for denitrification. However, the mechanisms and rates of So-based denitrification, which depend on a biofilm development on a solid So surface, are not well understood. We used completely-mixed reactors packed with So chips to systematically explore the behavior of So-based denitrification as a function of the bulk nitrate (NO3-) concentration and biofilm development. High-purity (99.5%) and agricultural-grade (90% purity) So chips were tested to explore differences in performance. NO3- fluxes followed a Monod-type relationship with the bulk NO3- concentration. For high-purity So, the maximum NO3- flux increased from 0.4 gN/m2-d at 21 days to 0.9 g N/m2-d at around 100 days, but then decreased to 0.65 gN/m2-d at 161 days. The apparent (extant) half-saturation constant for NO3- KSapp, based on the bulk NO3- concentration and NO3- fluxes into the biofilm, increased from 0.1 mgN/L at 21 days to 0.8 mgN/L at 161 days, reflecting the increasing mass transfer resistance as the biofilm thickness increased. Nitrite (NO2-) accumulation became significant at bulk NO3- concentration above 0.2 mgN/L. The behavior of the agricultural-grade So was very similar to the high-purity So. The kinetic behavior of So-based denitrification was consistent with substrate counter-diffusion, where the soluble sulfur species diffuse from the So particle into the base of the biofilm, while NO3- diffuses into the biofilm from the bulk. Initially, the fluxes were low due to biomass limitation (thin biofilms). As the biofilm thickness increased with time, the fluxes first increased, stabilized, and then decreased. The decrease was probably due to increasing diffusional resistance in the thick biofilm. Results suggest that fluxes comparable to heterotrophic biofilm processes can be achieved, but careful management of biofilm accumulation is important to maintain high fluxes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {It is important for probiotics that are currently utilized in the dairy industry to have clear genetic backgrounds. In this study, the genetic characteristics of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3 were studied by undertaking a comparative genomics study, and key genes for adaptation to different environments were investigated and validated in vitro. Evidence for horizontal gene transfer resulting in strong self-defense mechanisms was detected in the ZW3 genome. We identified a series of genes relevant for dairy environments and the intestinal tract, particularly for extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. Reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) revealed significant increases in the relative expression of pgm, ugp, and uge during the mid-logarithmic phase, whereas the expression of pgi was higher at the beginning of the stationary phase. The enzymes encoded by these four genes concertedly regulated carbon flux, which in turn modulated the production of EPS precursors. Moreover, ZW3 tolerated pH 3.5 and 3% bile salt and retained cell surface hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation. In conclusion, we explored the potential of ZW3 for utilization in both the dairy industry and in probiotic applications. Additionally, we elucidated the regulation of the relevant genes involved in EPS production. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Specific primers flanking the variable region (~800 pb) within the pyrG gene encoding the CTP synthetase were designed by means of gene sequences retrieved from the genomes of strains belonging to the family Bifidobacteriaceae. The functionality and specificity of the primers were subsequently tested on the wild (7) and type strains of bifidobacteria (36) and scardovia (7). Comparative and phylogenetic studies based on obtained sequences revealed actual significance in classification and phylogeny of the Bifidobacteriaceae family. Gene statistics (percentages of mean sequence similarities and identical sites, mean number of nucleotide differences, P- and K-distances) and phylogenetic analyses (congruence between tree topologies, percentages of bootstrap values >50 and 70%) indicate that the pyrG gene represents an alternative identification and phylogenetic marker exhibiting higher discriminatory power among strains, (sub)species, and genera than the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences of the particular gene fragment, simply achieved through specific primers, enable more precisely to classify and evaluate phylogeny of the family Bifidobacteriaceae including, with some exceptions, health-promoting probiotic bacteria. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Results of genome analysis of a member of the family Ferroplasmaceae, Acidiplasma sp. strain MBA-1, an extremely acidophilic, moderately thermophilic archaeon oxidizing ferrous iron under oxic conditions and utilizing organic compounds. This strain was previously shown to predominate in the community carrying out biooxidation of pyrite-arsenopyrite gold-bearing concentrate. The genome was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 2306800 pairwise reads were obtained, corresponding to 300-fold coverage. Assembly was carried out by three programs in parallel. The optimal assembly contained nine contigs, the genome size was 1747364 bp, and N50 was 446845 bp. Annotation of the genome revealed 1749 protein-encoding sequences, as well as 46 tRNA genes and one rRNA gene copy. The results of genome analysis confirmed the previous data on the physiology of this organism. The gene of sulfocyanin (TZ01_06185), a blue copper-containing protein playing the key role in the iron-oxidizing electron transport chain, was identified in the genome. The genes encoding sulfur oxidoreductase (TZ01_04750) and sulfateadenilyl transferase (TZ01_04545), the enzymes of sulfur oxidation, were also identified. The genes involved in the transport and catabolism of organic compounds and the genes of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle were revealed. The genome of Acidiplasma sp. MBA-1 is the first genome of this genus deposited to a public database DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (accession no.

	abstract = {Extremely acidophilic microorganisms (pH optima for growth of =3) are utilized for the extraction of metals from sulfide minerals in the industrial biotechnology of "biomining." A long term goal for biomining has been development of microbial consortia able to withstand increased chloride concentrations for use in regions where freshwater is scarce. However, when challenged by elevated salt, acidophiles experience both osmotic stress and an acidification of the cytoplasm due to a collapse of the inside positive membrane potential, leading to an influx of protons. In this study, we tested the ability of the halotolerant acidophile Acidihalobacter prosperus to grow and catalyze sulfide mineral dissolution in elevated concentrations of salt and identified chloride tolerance mechanisms in Ac. prosperus as well as the chloride susceptible species, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Ac. prosperus had optimum iron oxidation at 20 g L-1 NaCl while At. ferrooxidans iron oxidation was inhibited in the presence of 6 g L-1 NaCl. The tolerance to chloride in Ac. prosperus was consistent with electron microscopy, determination of cell viability, and bioleaching capability. The Ac. prosperus proteomic response to elevated chloride concentrations included the production of osmotic stress regulators that potentially induced production of the compatible solute, ectoine uptake protein, and increased iron oxidation resulting in heightened electron flow to drive proton export by the F0F1 ATPase. In contrast, At. ferrooxidans responded to low levels of Cl- with a generalized stress response, decreased iron oxidation, and an increase in central carbon metabolism. One potential adaptation to high chloride in the Ac. prosperus Rus protein involved in ferrous iron oxidation was an increase in the negativity of the surface potential of Rus Form I (and Form II) that could help explain how it can be active under elevated chloride concentrations. These data have been used to create a model of chloride tolerance in the salt tolerant and susceptible species Ac. prosperus and At. ferrooxidans, respectively. © 2017 Dopson, Holmes, Lazcano, McCredden, Bryan, Mulroney, Steuart, Jackaman and Watkin.},

As the site of CO2 fixation, it serves an essential role in the carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism of many chemoautotrophs and all cyanobacteria. Carboxysomes and other bacterial microcompartments self-assemble through specific protein-protein interactions that are typically mediated by conserved protein domains. In this review, we frame our current understanding of carboxysomes in the context of their component protein domains with their inherent function as the 'building blocks' of carboxysomes. These building blocks are organized in genetic modules (conserved chromosomal loci) that encode for carboxysomes and ancillary proteins essential for the integration of the organelle with the rest of cellular metabolism. This conceptual framework provides the foundation for 'plug-and-play' engineering of carboxysomes as CO2 fixation modules in a variety of biotechnological applications. © 2017 Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {Background. The emergence of functions in biological systems is a long-standing issue that can now be addressed at the cell level with the emergence of high throughput technologies for genome sequencing and phenotyping. The reconstruction of complete metabolic networks for various organisms is a key outcome of the analysis of these data, giving access to a global view of cell functioning. The analysis of metabolic networks may be carried out by simply considering the architecture of the reaction network or by taking into account the stoichiometry of reactions. In both approaches, this analysis is generally centered on the outcome of the network and considers all metabolic compounds to be equivalent in this respect. As in the case of genes and reactions, about which the concept of essentiality has been developed, it seems, however, that some metabolites play crucial roles in system responses, due to the cell structure or the internal wiring of the metabolic network. Results. We propose a classification of metabolic compounds according to their capacity to influence the activation of targeted functions (generally the growth phenotype) in a cell. We generalize the concept of essentiality to metabolites and introduce the concept of the phenotypic essential metabolite (PEM) which influences the growth phenotype according to sustainability, producibility or optimal-efficiency criteria. We have developed and made available a tool, Conquests, which implements a method combining graph-based and flux-based analysis, two approaches that are usually considered separately. The identification of PEMs is made effective by using a logical programming approach. Conclusion. The exhaustive study of phenotypic essential metabolites in six genomescale metabolic models suggests that the combination and the comparison of graph, stoichiometry and optimal flux-based criteria allows some features of the metabolic network functionality to be deciphered by focusing on a small number of compounds. © 2017 Laniau et al.},

	abstract = {Citrus canker is a plant disease caused by Gram-negative bacteria from the genus Xanthomonas. The most virulent species is Xanthomonas citri ssp. citri (XAC), which attacks a wide range of citrus hosts. Differential proteomic analysis of the periplasm-enriched fraction was performed for XAC cells grown in pathogenicity-inducing (XAM-M) and pathogenicity-non-inducing (nutrient broth) media using two-dimensional electrophoresis combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Amongst the 40 proteins identified, transglycosylase was detected in a highly abundant spot in XAC cells grown under inducing condition. Additional up-regulated proteins related to cellular envelope metabolism included glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose-3,5-epimerase and peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans-isomerase. Phosphoglucomutase and superoxide dismutase proteins, known to be involved in pathogenicity in other Xanthomonas species or organisms, were also detected. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses for transglycosylase and superoxide dismutase confirmed that these proteins were up-regulated under inducing condition, consistent with the proteomic results. Multiple spots for the 60-kDa chaperonin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified, suggesting the presence of post-translational modifications. We propose that substantial alterations in cellular envelope metabolism occur during the XAC infectious process, which are related to several aspects, from defence against reactive oxygen species to exopolysaccharide synthesis. Our results provide new candidates for virulence-related proteins, whose abundance correlates with the induction of pathogenicity and virulence genes, such as hrpD6, hrpG, hrpB7, hpa1 and hrpX. The results present new potential targets against XAC to be investigated in further functional studies. © 2016 BSPP AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.},

	abstract = {Thermithiobacillus tepidarius DSM 3134T was originally isolated (1983) from the waters of a sulfidic spring entering the Roman Baths (Temple of Sulis-Minerva) at Bath, United Kingdom and is an obligate chemolithoautotroph growing at the expense of reduced sulfur species. This strain has a genome size of 2,958,498 bp. Here we report the genome sequence, annotation and characteristics. The genome comprises 2,902 protein coding and 66 RNA coding genes. Genes responsible for the transaldolase variant of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle were identified along with a biosynthetic horseshoe in lieu of Krebs' cycle sensu stricto. Terminal oxidases were identified, viz. cytochrome c oxidase (cbb 3, EC 1.9.3.1) and ubiquinol oxidase (bd, EC 1.10.3.10). Metalloresistance genes involved in pathways of arsenic and cadmium resistance were found. Evidence of horizontal gene transfer accounting for 5.9 % of the protein-coding genes was found, including transfer from Thiobacillus spp. and Methylococcus capsulatus Bath, isolated from the same spring. A sox gene cluster was found, similar in structure to those from other Acidithiobacillia - by comparison with Thiobacillus thioparus and Paracoccus denitrificans, an additional gene between soxA and soxB was found, annotated as a DUF302-family protein of unknown function. As the Kelly-Friedrich pathway of thiosulfate oxidation (encoded by sox) is not used in Thermithiobacillus spp., the role of the operon (if any) in this species remains unknown. We speculate that DUF302 and sox genes may have a role in periplasmic trithionate oxidation. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans is an acidophile that often occurs in low temperature acid mine drainage, e.g., that located at high altitude. Being able to inhabit the extreme environment, the bacterium must possess strategies to copy with the survival stress. Nonetheless, information on the strategies is in demand. Here, genomic and transcriptomic assays were performed to illuminate the adaptation mechanisms of an A. ferrivorans strain YL15, to the alpine acid mine drainage environment in Yulong copper mine in southwest China. Genomic analysis revealed that strain has a gene repertoire for metal-resistance, e.g., genes coding for the mer operon and a variety of transporters/efflux proteins, and for low pH adaptation, such as genes for hopanoid-synthesis and the sodium:proton antiporter. Genes for various DNA repair enzymes and synthesis of UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids precursor indicated hypothetical UV radiation - resistance mechanisms in strain YL15. In addition, it has two types of the acquired immune system-type III-B and type I-F CRISPR/Cas modules against invasion of foreign genetic elements. RNA-seq based analysis uncovered that strain YL15 uses a set of mechanisms to adapt to low temperature. Genes involved in protein synthesis, transmembrane transport, energy metabolism and chemotaxis showed increased levels of RNA transcripts. Furthermore, a bacterioferritin Dps gene had higher RNA transcript counts at 6°C, possibly implicated in protecting DNA against oxidative stress at low temperature. The study represents the first to comprehensively unveil the adaptation mechanisms of an acidophilic bacterium to the acid mine drainage in alpine regions. © 2017 Peng et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

	abstract = {Microbacterium oleivorans A9 is a uranium-tolerant actinobacteria isolated from the trench T22 located near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This site is contaminated with different radionuclides including uranium. To observe the molecular changes at the proteome level occurring in this strain upon uranyl exposure and understand molecular mechanisms explaining its uranium tolerance, we established its draft genome and used this raw information to perform an in-depth proteogenomics study. High-throughput proteomics were performed on cells exposed or not to 10 μM uranyl nitrate sampled at three previously identified phases of uranyl tolerance. We experimentally detected and annotated 1532 proteins and highlighted a total of 591 proteins for which abundances were significantly differing between conditions. Notably, proteins involved in phosphate and iron metabolisms show high dynamics. A large ratio of proteins more abundant upon uranyl stress, are distant from functionally-annotated known proteins, highlighting the lack of fundamental knowledge regarding numerous key molecular players from soil bacteria. Biological significance: Microbacterium oleivorans A9 is an interesting environmental model to understand biological processes engaged in tolerance to radionuclides. Using an innovative proteogenomics approach, we explored its molecular mechanisms involved in uranium tolerance. We sequenced its genome, interpreted high-throughput proteomic data against a six-reading frame ORF database deduced from the draft genome, annotated the identified proteins and compared protein abundances from cells exposed or not to uranyl stress after a cascade search. These data show that a complex cellular response to uranium occurs in Microbacterium oleivorans A9, where one third of the experimental proteome is modified. In particular, the uranyl stress perturbed the phosphate and iron metabolic pathways. Furthermore, several transporters have been identified to be specifically associated to uranyl stress, paving the way to the development of biotechnological tools for uranium decontamination. © 2017},

	abstract = {Naturally occurring sulfide rich deposits are common along the northern Baltic Sea coast that when exposed to air, release large amounts of acid and metals into receiving water bodies. This causes severe environmental implications for agriculture, forestry, and building of infrastructure. In this study, we investigated the efficiency of ultrafine-grained calcium carbonate and peat (both separately and in combination) to mitigate acid and metal release. The experiments were carried out aerobically that mimicked summer conditions when the groundwater level is low and acid sulfate soils are exposed to oxygen, and anaerobically that is similar to autumn to spring conditions. The ultrafine-grained calcium carbonate dissipated well in the soil and its effect alone and when mixed with peat raised the pH and reduced pyrite dissolution while peat alone was similar to the controls and did not halt metal and acid release. High throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified populations most similar to characterized acidophiles in the control and peat treated incubations while the acidophilic like populations were altered in the calcium carbonate alone and calcium carbonate plus peat treated acid sulfate soils. Coupled with the geochemistry data, it was suggested that the acidophiles were inactivated by the high pH in the presence of calcium carbonate but catalyzed pyrite dissolution in the controls and peat incubations. In conclusion, the anaerobic conditions during winter would likely be sufficient to mitigate acid production and metal release from acid sulfate soils and in the summer, treatment with calcium carbonate was the best mitigation method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Organic amendments modified key physicochemical conditions, including water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, and levels of labile organic carbon and nitrogen. SM elevated available C and N, and microbial diversity, respiration rate and enzymatic activities in the amended tailings, regardless of plant species established. Specifically, SM amendment elevated the abundance of Bacteroidetes, especially the organic matter decomposers (e.g., Algoriphagus, Chitinophagaceae). Although BC addition reduced the Cu availability and uptake by plants, it had little impacts on levels of available nutrients, microbial biomass and enzymatic activities in the treated tailings. The BC amendment enhanced the abundance of Actinobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, among which Fe- and S-oxidizing bacteria (Acidithiobacillus) appeared to be the most abundant. The improved water-soluble organic carbon and nitrogen status in SM amended tailings were the strongest driving factors in the shift of bacterial communities towards organoheterotrophic dominance. The plant biomass-based option (e.g., SM) together with tolerant pioneer plants as hosts would be preferred for eco-engineering the neutral Cu-Mo-Au tailings into functional technosol. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The genome of the acidophilic, bioleaching bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, strain ATCC 23270, contains 95 predicted tRNA genes. Thirty-six of these genes (all 20 species) are clustered within an actively excising integrative-conjugative element (ICEAfe1). We speculated that these tRNA genes might have a role in adapting the bacterial tRNA pool to the codon usage of ICEAfe1 genes. To answer this question, we performed theoretical calculations of the global tRNA adaptation index to the entire A. ferrooxidans genome with and without the ICEAfe1 encoded tRNA genes. Based on these calculations, we observed that tRNAs encoded in ICEAfe1 negatively contribute to adapt the tRNA pool to the codon use in A. ferrooxidans. Although some of the tRNAs encoded in ICEAfe1 are functional in aminoacylation or protein synthesis, we found that they are expressed at low levels. These findings, along with the identification of a tRNA-like RNA encoded in the same cluster, led us to speculate that tRNA genes encoded in the mobile genetic element ICEAfe1 might have acquired mutations that would result in either inactivation or the acquisition of new functions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a density-dependent mechanism allowing bacteria to synchronize their physiological activities, mediated by a wide range of signaling molecules including N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs). Production of AHL has been identified in various marine strains of Proteobacteria. However, the chemical diversity of these molecules still needs to be further explored. In this study, we examined the diversity of AHLs produced by strain MOLA 401, a marine Alphaproteobacterium that belongs to the ubiquitous Rhodobacteraceae family. We combined an original biosensors-based guided screening of extract microfractions with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), High Resolution MS/MS and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. This approach revealed the unsuspected capacity of a single Rhodobacteraceae strain to synthesize 20 different compounds, which are most likely AHLs. Also, some of these AHLs possessed original features that have never been previously observed, including long (up to 19 carbons) and poly-hydroxylated acyl side chains, revealing new molecular adaptations of QS to planktonic life and a larger molecular diversity than expected of molecules involved in cell-cell signaling within a single strain. © 2017 Doberva, Stien, Sorres, Hue, Sanchez-Ferandin, Eparvier, Ferandin, Lebaron and Lami.},

	abstract = {The spatial-temporal distribution of populations in various econiches is thought to be potentially related to individual differences in the utilization of nutrients or other resources, but their functional roles in the microbial communities remain elusive. We compared differentiation in gene repertoire and metabolic profiles, with a focus on the potential functional traits of three commonly recognized members (Acidithiobacillus caldus, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans) in bioleaching heaps. Comparative genomics revealed that intra-species divergence might be driven by horizontal gene transfer. These co-occurring bacteria shared a few homologous genes, which significantly suggested the genomic differences between these organisms. Notably, relatively more genes assigned to the Clusters of Orthologous Groups category [G] (carbohydrate transport and metabolism) were identified in Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans compared to the two other species, which probably indicated their mixotrophic capabilities that assimilate both organic and inorganic forms of carbon. Further inspection revealed distinctive metabolic capabilities involving carbon assimilation, nitrogen uptake, and iron-sulfur cycling, providing robust evidence for functional differences with respect to nutrient utilization. Therefore, we proposed that the mutual compensation of functionalities among these co-occurring organisms might provide a selective advantage for efficiently utilizing the limited resources in their habitats. Furthermore, it might be favorable to chemoautotrophs' lifestyles to form mutualistic interactions with these heterotrophic and/or mixotrophic acidophiles, whereby the latter could degrade organic compounds to effectively detoxify the environments. Collectively, the findings shed light on the genetic traits and potential metabolic activities of these organisms, and enable us to make some inferences about genomic and functional differences that might allow them to co-exist. © 2017 Zhang, Liu, Liang, Xiao, Ma, Guo, Miao, Liu, Peng, Huang and Yin.},

	abstract = {Chemosynthetic Fe-oxidizing communities are common at diffuse-flow hydrothermal vents throughout the world's oceans. The foundational members of these communities are the Zetaproteobacteria, a class of Proteobacteria that is primarily associated with ecosystems fueled by ferrous iron, Fe(II). We report here the discovery of two new isolates of Zetaproteobacteria isolated from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (TAG-1), and the Mariana back-arc (SV-108), that are unique in that they can utilize either Fe(II) or molecular hydrogen (H 2) as sole electron donor and oxygen as terminal electron acceptor for growth. Both strains precipitated Fe-oxyhydroxides as amorphous particulates. The cell doubling time on H 2 vs Fe(II) for TAG-1 was 14.1 vs 21.8 h, and for SV-108 it was 16.3 vs 20 h, and it appeared both strains could use either H 2 or Fe(II) simultaneously. The strains were close relatives, based on genomic analysis, and both possessed genes for the uptake NiFe-hydrogenase required for growth on H 2. These two strains belong to Zetaproteobacteria operational taxonomic unit 9 (ZetaOTU9). A meta-analysis of public databases found ZetaOTU9 was only associated with Fe(II)-rich habitats, and not in other environments where known H 2 -oxidizers exist. These results expand the metabolic repertoire of the Zetaproteobacteria, yet confirm that Fe(II) metabolism is the primary driver of their physiology and ecology. © 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli causing infection outside the gastrointestinal system are referred to as extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Avian pathogenic E. coli is a subgroup of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli and infections due to avian pathogenic E. coli have major impact on poultry production economy and welfare worldwide. An almost defining characteristic of avian pathogenic E. coli is the carriage of plasmids, which may encode virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinates. For the same reason, plasmids of avian pathogenic E. coli have been intensively studied. However, genes encoded by the chromosome may also be important for disease manifestation and antimicrobial resistance. For the E. coli strain APEC_O2 the plasmids have been sequenced and analyzed in several studies, and E. coli APEC_O2 may therefore serve as a reference strain in future studies. Here we describe the chromosomal features of E. coli APEC_O2. E. coli APEC_O2 is a sequence type ST135, has a chromosome of 4,908,820bp (plasmid removed), comprising 4672 protein-coding genes, 110 RNA genes, and 156 pseudogenes, with an average G+C content of 50.69%. We identified 82 insertion sequences as well as 4672 protein coding sequences, 12 predicated genomic islands, three prophage-related sequences, and two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats regions on the chromosome, suggesting the possible occurrence of horizontal gene transfer in this strain. The wildtype strain of E. coli APEC_O2 is resistant towards multiple antimicrobials, however, no (complete) antibiotic resistance genes were present on the chromosome, but a number of genes associated with extra-intestinal disease were identified. Together, the information provided here on E. coli APEC_O2 will assist in future studies of avian pathogenic E. coli strains, in particular regarding strain of E. coli APEC_O2, and aid in the general understanding of the pathogenesis of avian pathogenic E. coli. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Bacteria in genus Novosphingobium associated with biodegradation of substrates are prevalent in environments such as lakes, soil, sea, wood and sediments. To better understand the characteristics linked to their wide distribution and metabolic versatility, we report the whole genome sequence of Novosphingobium sp. THN1, a microcystin-degrading strain previously isolated by Jiang et al. (2011) from cyanobacteria-blooming water samples from Lake Taihu, China. We performed a genomic comparison analysis of Novosphingobium sp. THN1 with 21 other degradative Novosphingobium strains downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using 16S rRNA genes, core genes, protein-coding sequences, and average nucleotide identity of whole genomes. Orthologous protein analysis showed that the 22 genomes contained 674 core genes and each strain contained a high proportion of distributed genes that are shared by a subset of strains. Inspection of their genomic plasticity revealed a high number of insertion sequence elements and genomic islands that were distributed on both chromosomes and plasmids. We also compared the predicted functional profiles of the Novosphingobium protein-coding genes. The flexible genes and all protein-coding genes produced the same heatmap clusters. The COG annotations were used to generate a dendrogram correlated with the compounds degraded. Furthermore, the metabolic profiles predicted from KEGG pathways showed that the majority of genes involved in central carbon metabolism, nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate metabolism, energy metabolism and cell mobility (above 62.5%) are located on chromosomes. Whereas, a great many of genes involved in degradation pathways (21–50%) are located on plasmids. The abundance and distribution of aromatics-degradative mono- and dioxygenases varied among 22 Novosphingoibum strains. Comparative analysis of the microcystin-degrading mlr gene cluster provided evidence for horizontal acquisition of this cluster. The Novosphingobium sp. THN1 genome sequence contained all the functional genes crucial for microcystin degradation and the mlr gene cluster shared high sequence similarity (≥85%) with the sequences of other microcystin-degrading genera isolated from cyanobacteria-blooming water. Our results indicate that Novosphingobium species have high genomic and functional plasticity, rearranging their genomes according to environment variations and shaping their metabolic profiles by the substrates they are exposed to, to better adapt to their environments. © Copyright © 2018 Wang, Wang, Li, Bai, Li, Shen, Li, Li and Zhao.},

	abstract = {Drainage waters at the metal mining areas often have low pH and high content of dissolved metals due to oxidation of sulfide minerals. Extreme conditions limit microbial diversity in such habitats. A microbial community of cold acid mine drainage (6.5°C, pH 2.65) at the Sherlovaya Gora polymetallic open-cast mine (Transbaikal region, Eastern Siberia, Russia) was studied using metagenomic techniques. Most of microorganisms belonged to a single uncultured lineage representing a new species of the Betaproteobacteria genus Gallionella. Bacteria of the genera Thiobacillus, Acidobacterium, Acidisphaera, and Acidithiobacillus were the minor components of the community. Almost complete (3.4 Mb) composite genome of the new bacterial lineage designated Candidatus Gallionella acididurans ShG14-8 was reconstructed using metagenomic data. Genome analysis revealed that Fe(II) oxidation probably involved the cytochromes localized on the outer cell membrane. The electron transport chain included NADH dehydrogenase, a cytochrome bc1 complex, an alternative complex III, and bd-, cbb3-, and bo3-types cytochrome oxidases. Oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds probably involved the Sox system, sulfide–quinone oxidoreductase, adenyl sulfate reductase, and sulfate adenyltransferase. The genes involved in autotrophic carbon assimilation via the Calvin cycle were present, while no pathway for nitrogen fixation was revealed. High numbers of RND metal transporters and P type ATPases were probably responsible for resistance to heavy metals. The new microorganism was an aerobic chemolithoautotroph that belonged to the group of psychrotolerant iron- and sulfur-oxidizing acidophiles of the family Gallionellaceae, which are widely distributed in acid mine drainage. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Origin of newbiological functions is a complex phenomenon ranging fromsingle-nucleotide substitutions to the gain of newgenes via horizontal gene transfer or duplication. Neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of proteins is often attributed to the emergence of paralogs that are subject to relaxed purifying selection or positive selection and thus evolve at accelerated rates. Such phenomena potentially could be detected as anomalies in the phylogenies of the respective gene families. We developed a computational pipeline to search for such anomalies in 1,834 orthologous clusters of archaeal genes, focusing on lineage-specific subfamilies that significantly deviate from the expected rate of evolution. Multiple potential cases of neofunctionalization and subfunctionalizationwere identified, including some ancient, house-keeping gene families, such as ribosomal protein S10, general transcription factor TFIIB and chaperone Hsp20. As expected,many cases of apparent acceleration of evolution are associatedwith lineage-specific gene duplication. On other occasions, long branches in phylogenetic trees correspond to horizontal gene transfer across long evolutionary distances. Significant deceleration of evolution is less common than acceleration, and the underlying causes are notwell understood; functional shifts accompanied by increased constraints could be involved.Many gene families appear to be "highly evolvable," that is, includeboth long and short branches. Even in the absence of precise functional predictions, this approach allows one to select targets for experimentation in search of new biology. © The Author(s) 2017.

As a crucial protein involved in iron oxidation-reduction and electron transfer, thorough investigation of ferredoxin was of great significance. Aim of the study is to study the structure and function of ferredoxin laid a theoretical foundation for understanding energy accumulation, metabolism and electron transfer of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Materials and methods: Eleven kinds of ferredoxin sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database. Aspects concluding basic physicochemical properties, conserved domain, protein modification, subcellular localization, advanced structures prediction, homology and protein interaction network were predicted on the application of combination of software and online tools. Results: The results showed that all proteins were electrically neutral in acidic solution except ACK80487.1. Minority of the proteins (three to eleven) were hydrophilic protein. Majority of the proteins were unstable with exceptions of ACK79455.1 & ACK80389.1. The cytoplasm was the place where they played a part. Through the comprehensive forecast, four proteins were involved in nitrogen fixation reaction; two proteins mainly participated in iron sulfur-cluster assembly; four from eleven took effect in oxidation and reduction reactions; the rest one play a major role in nucleic acid reaction. Conclusion: The basic physicochemical properties, the secondary structure and tertiary structure of protein, subcellular localization, signal peptide and transmembrane domain analysis showed the protein was characterized by diversity and implied the complexity of electron transfer and energy mechanism of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.},

	abstract = {Iron-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus spp. are applied worldwide in biomining industry to extract metals from sulfide minerals. They derive energy for survival through Fe2+ oxidation and generate Fe3+ for the dissolution of sulfide minerals. However, molecular mechanisms of their iron oxidation still remain elusive. A novel two-cytochrome-encoding gene cluster (named tce gene cluster) encoding a high-molecular-weight cytochrome c (AFE_1428) and a c4-type cytochrome c552 (AFE_1429) in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 was first identified in this study. Bioinformatic analysis together with transcriptional study showed that AFE_1428 and AFE_1429 were the corresponding paralog of Cyc2 (AFE_3153) and Cyc1 (AFE_3152) which were encoded by the extensively studied rus operon and had been proven involving in ferrous iron oxidation. Both AFE_1428 and AFE_1429 contained signal peptide and the classic heme-binding motif(s) as their corresponding paralog. The modeled structure of AFE_1429 showed high resemblance to Cyc1. AFE_1428 and AFE_1429 were preferentially transcribed as their corresponding paralogs in the presence of ferrous iron as sole energy source as compared with sulfur. The tce gene cluster is highly conserved in the genomes of four phylogenetic-related A. ferrooxidans strains that were originally isolated from different sites separated with huge geographical distance, which further implies the importance of this gene cluster. Collectively, AFE_1428 and AFE_1429 involve in Fe2+ oxidation like their corresponding paralog by integrating with the metalloproteins encoded by rus operon. This study provides novel insights into the Fe2+ oxidation mechanism in Fe2+-oxidizing A. ferrooxidans ssp. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The composition of microbial communities of acid mine drainage (AMD) in two wells drilled in the terrace of the Sherlovaya Gora open-cast polymetallic ores mine (Eastern Siberia) was studied. While drainage water filling two wells, ShG14-1 and ShG14-8, had similar values of pH (2.6), Eh (447–494 mV), and temperature (6.5°C), the water in the first well contained more metals and sulfate. The water in ShG14-1 and ShG14-8 contained, respectively, 1898 and 434 mg/L of iron, 734 and 49 mg/L of manganese, 81 and 7 mg/L of copper, 3597 and 787 mg/L of zinc, and 15990 and 3632 mg/L of sulfate. Molecular analysis of the microbial communities was performed using pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragments. The ShG14-8 microbial community included such bacterial taxa typically found in AMD sites as Gallionella (38.8% of total 16S rRNA gene sequences), Ferrovum (4.4%), Acidiphilium (9.1%), Acidisphaera (8.2%), Acidithiobacillus (7.2%), and Leptospirillum (4.6%). In the ShG14-1 sample with higher content of metals, strict acidophiles Acidithiobacillus (16.0%) and Leptospirillum (25.4%) were more abundant, while Gallionella, Ferrovum, Acidiphilium and Acidisphaera were almost absent. Ferrimicrobium (16.8%) and Sulfobacillus (1.4%) were detected in ShG14-1 but not in ShG14-8. Thus, the increase in concentration of metals in the acid mine drainage water under the same value of total acidity substantially altered the composition of the microbial community, preventing the development of “moderate” alpha- and beta-proteobacterial acidophiles, so that the community was dominated by the bacteria characteristic of the extremely acidic drainage waters. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Chemolithotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) could theoretically inhabit any environment where Fe(II) and O2 (or nitrate) coexist. Until recently, marine Fe-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria had primarily been observed in benthic and subsurface settings, but not redox-stratified water columns. This may be due to the challenges that a pelagic lifestyle would pose for Zetaproteobacteria, given low Fe(II) concentrations in modern marine waters and the possibility that Fe oxyhydroxide biominerals could cause cells to sink. However, we recently cultivated Zetaproteobacteria from the Chesapeake Bay oxic-anoxic transition zone, suggesting that they can survive and contribute to biogeochemical cycling in a stratified estuary. Here we describe the isolation, characterization, and genomes of two new species, Mariprofundus aestuarium CP-5 and Mariprofundus ferrinatatus CP-8, which are the first Zetaproteobacteria isolates from a pelagic environment. We looked for adaptations enabling strains CP-5 and CP-8 to overcome the challenges of living in a low Fe redoxcline with frequent O2 fluctuations due to tidal mixing. We found that the CP strains produce distinctive dreadlock-like Fe oxyhydroxide structures that are easily shed, which would help cells maintain suspension in the water column. These oxides are by-products of Fe(II) oxidation, likely catalyzed by the putative Fe(II) oxidase encoded by the cyc2 gene, present in both CP-5 and CP-8 genomes; the consistent presence of cyc2 in all microaerophilic FeOB and other FeOB genomes supports its putative role in Fe(II) oxidation. The CP strains also have two gene clusters associated with biofilm formation (Wsp system and the Widespread Colonization Island) that are absent or rare in other Zetaproteobacteria. We propose that biofilm formation enables the CP strains to attach to FeS particles and form flocs, an advantageous strategy for scavenging Fe(II) and developing low [O2] microenvironments within more oxygenated waters. However, the CP strains appear to be adapted to somewhat higher concentrations of O2, as indicated by the presence of genes encoding aa3-type cytochrome c oxidases, but not the cbb3-type found in all other Zetaproteobacteria isolate genomes. Overall, our results reveal adaptations for life in a physically dynamic, low Fe(II) water column, suggesting that niche-specific strategies can enable Zetaproteobacteria to live in any environment with Fe(II). © 2017 Chiu, Kato, McAllister, Field and Chan.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (GRA), and their derivatives are promising materials for a wide range of applications such as pollutant removal, enzyme immobilization, bioimaging, biosensors, and drug delivery and are rapidly increasing in use and increasingly mass produced. The biodegradation of carbon nanomaterials by microbes and enzymes is now of great importance for both reducing their toxicity to living organisms and removing them from the environment. Here we review recent progress in the biodegradation field from the point of view of the primary microbes and enzymes that can degrade these nanomaterials, along with experimental and molecular simulation methods for the exploration of nanomaterial degradation. Further efforts should primarily aim toward expanding the repertoire of microbes and enzymes and exploring optimal conditions for the degradation of nanomaterials. Multiple types of microbes including bacteria and fungi have the ability to degrade carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (GRA), and their derivatives and in the future more species with this ability will be found. Current applications of numerous enzymes in the biodegradation of CNTs, GRA, and their derivatives provide crucial clues for the design and development of safe nanomaterials and are helpful in understanding their fates in the environment. A variety of experimental and molecular simulation technologies have been used to jointly explore the biodegradation of CNTs, GRA, and their derivatives. Biodegradation approaches for CNTs, GRA, and their derivatives are moving from theory to plausible remediation practice for the removal of these materials from the environment but still face many challenges. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Thiobacillus thioparus DSM 505T is one of first two isolated strains of inorganic sulfur-oxidising Bacteria. The original strain of T. thioparus was lost almost 100 years ago and the working type strain is Culture CT (=DSM 505T = ATCC 8158T) isolated by Starkey in 1934 from agricultural soil at Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA. It is an obligate chemolithoautotroph that conserves energy from the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds using the Kelly-Trudinger pathway and uses it to fix carbon dioxide It is not capable of heterotrophic or mixotrophic growth. The strain has a genome size of 3,201,518 bp. Here we report the genome sequence, annotation and characteristics. The genome contains 3,135 protein coding and 62 RNA coding genes. Genes encoding the transaldolase variant of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle were also identified and an operon encoding carboxysomes, along with Smith's biosynthetic horseshoe in lieu of Krebs' cycle sensu stricto. Terminal oxidases were identified, viz. cytochrome c oxidase (cbb3, EC 1.9.3.1) and ubiquinol oxidase (bd, EC 1.10.3.10). There is a partial sox operon of the Kelly-Friedrich pathway of inorganic sulfur-oxidation that contains soxXYZAB genes but lacking soxCDEF, there is also a lack of the DUF302 gene previously noted in the sox operon of other members of the 'Proteobacteria' that can use trithionate as an energy source. In spite of apparently not growing anaerobically with denitrification, the nar, nir, nor and nos operons encoding enzymes of denitrification are found in the T. thioparus genome, in the same arrangements as in the true denitrifier T. denitrificans. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a gram-negative chemolithoautotrophic γ-proteobacterium. It typically grows at an external pH of 2 using the oxidation of ferrous ions by oxygen, producing ferric ions and water, while fixing carbon dioxide from the environment. A. ferrooxidans is of great interest for biomining and environmental applications, as it can process mineral ores and alleviate the negative environmental consequences derived from the mining processes. In this study, the first genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 was generated (iMC507). A total of 587 metabolic and transport/exchange reactions, 507 genes and 573 metabolites organized in over 42 subsystems were incorporated into the model. Based on a new genetic algorithm approach, that integrates flux balance analysis, chemiosmotic theory, and physiological data, the proton translocation stoichiometry for a number of enzymes and maintenance parameters under aerobic chemolithoautotrophic conditions using three different electron donors were estimated. Furthermore, a detailed electron transfer and carbon flux distributions during chemolithoautotrophic growth using ferrous ion, tetrathionate and thiosulfate were determined and reported. Finally, 134 growth-coupled designs were calculated that enables Extracellular Polysaccharide production. iMC507 serves as a knowledgebase for summarizing and categorizing the information currently available for A. ferrooxidans and enables the understanding and engineering of Acidithiobacillus and similar species from a comprehensive model-driven perspective for biomining applications. © 2016.},

	abstract = {Leptospirillum ferriphilum plays a major role in acidic, metal-rich environments, where it represents one of the most prevalent iron oxidizers. These milieus include acid rock and mine drainage as well as biomining operations. Despite its perceived importance, no complete genome sequence of the type strain of this model species is available, limiting the possibilities to investigate the strategies and adaptations that Leptospirillum ferriphilum DSM 14647T (here referred to as Leptospirillum ferriphilumT) applies to survive and compete in its niche. This study presents a complete, circular genome of Leptospirillum ferriphilumT obtained by PacBio singlemolecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing for use as a high-quality reference. Analysis of the functionally annotated genome, mRNA transcripts, and protein concentrations revealed a previously undiscovered nitrogenase cluster for atmospheric nitrogen fixation and elucidated metabolic systems taking part in energy conservation, carbon fixation, pH homeostasis, heavy metal tolerance, the oxidative stress response, chemotaxis and motility, quorum sensing, and biofilm formation. Additionally, mRNA transcript counts and protein concentrations were compared between cells grown in continuous culture using ferrous iron as the substrate and those grown in bioleaching cultures containing chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). Adaptations of Leptospirillum ferriphilumT to growth on chalcopyrite included the possibly enhanced production of reducing power, reduced carbon dioxide fixation, as well as elevated levels of RNA transcripts and proteins involved in heavy metal resistance, with special emphasis on copper efflux systems. Finally, the expression and translation of genes responsible for chemotaxis and motility were enhanced. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Acidophile bacteria belonging to the Acidithiobacillus genus are pivotal players for the bioleaching of metallic values such as copper. Cell adherence to ores and biofilm formation, mediated by the production of extracellular polymeric substances, strongly favors bioleaching activity. In recent years, the second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) has emerged as a central regulator for biofilm formation in bacteria. C-di-GMP pathways have been reported in different Acidithiobacillus species; however, c-di-GMP effectors and signal transduction networks are still largely uncharacterized in these extremophile species. Here we investigated Pel exopolysaccharide and its role in biofilm formation by sulfur-oxidizing species Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. We identified 39 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins involved in c-di-GMP metabolism and signal transduction, including the c-di-GMP effector protein PelD, a structural component of the biosynthesis apparatus for Pel exopolysaccharide production. We found that intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations and transcription levels of pel genes were higher in At. thiooxidans biofilm cells compared to planktonic ones. By developing an At. thiooxidans ΔpelD null-mutant strain we revealed that Pel exopolysaccharide is involved in biofilm structure and development. Further studies are still necessary to understand how Pel biosynthesis is regulated in Acidithiobacillus species, nevertheless these results represent the first characterization of a c-di-GMP effector protein involved in biofilm formation by acidophile species. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen with several clones being frequently associated with outbreaks in hospital settings. ST395 is among these so-called ‘international’ clones. We aimed here to define the biological features that could have helped the implantation and spread of the clone ST395 in hospital settings. The complete genome of a multidrug resistant index isolate (DHS01) of a large hospital outbreak was analysed. We identified DHS01-specific genetic elements, among which were identified those shared with a panel of six independent ST395 isolates responsible for outbreaks in other hospitals. DHS01 has the fifth largest chromosome of the species (7.1 Mbp), with most of its 1555 accessory genes borne by either genomic islands (GIs, n=48) or integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs, n=5). DHS01 is multidrug resistant mostly due to chromosomal mutations. It displayed signatures of adaptation to chronic infection in part due to the loss of a 131 kbp chromosomal fragment. Four GIs were specific to the clone ST395 and contained genes involved in metabolism (GI-4), in virulence (GI-6) and in resistance to copper (GI-7). GI-7 harboured an array of six copper transporters and was shared with nonpathogenic Pseudomonas sp. retrieved from copper-contaminated environments. Copper resistance was confirmed phenotypically in all other ST395 isolates and possibly accounted for the spreading capability of the clone in hospital outbreaks, where water networks have been incriminated. This suggests that genes transferred from copper-polluted environments may have favoured the implantation and spread of the international clone P. aeruginosa ST395 in hospital settings. © 2017 The Authors.},

In this research, indigenous bacterial communities residing in oil-bearing sandstone cores, taken from oil wells in Fang oil field in Northern Thailand, were investigated using the Ion Torrent PGM sequencing method. Based on 16rRNA gene sequences, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were found to be the predominant phyla, and Bacillus, Sinomonas, Paenibacillus and Hydrogenophaga were the major genera. Thermotolerant lipase-esterase and urease producing bacteria were also isolated from the oil-bearing sandstone core samples. One lipase-esterase producing isolate, Bacillus licheniformis L3-2, produced the enzyme with highest activity at 80 °C. The enzyme retained up to 50% of its activity after incubation at 60 °C for 4 h. The results suggest the possibility of applying an in situ EOR approach using a combination of Enzyme Enhanced Oil Recovery (EEOR) and Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) methods, with this lipase-esterase producing Bacillus licheniformis isolate, which is indigenous to one of the wells in this oil field. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

However, a lack of genetic tools has limited the further development of this organism for industrial bioprocesses. Using prior microarray studies that identified genes, which may express differentially in response to the availability of iron and sulfur, the cycA1 and tusA promoter sequences have been characterized for their ability to drive green fluorescent protein expression. The promoters exhibited opposite control behavior, where the cycA1 sequence was repressed and the tusA promoter was induced by the presence of sulfur in the growth medium. Sulfur was found to be the dominant signal. The sulfur IC50 for cycA1 was 0.56 mM (18 mg/L), whereas the sulfur EC50 of tusA was 2.5 mM (80 mg/L). Together these sequences provide two new tools to selectively induce or repress gene expression in A. ferrooxidans. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an important industrial organism; however, genetic tools for control of gene expression do not exist. Here, we report the identification of promoter sequences that allow for the development of control of gene expression for engineering this organism. © 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	abstract = {Extremely acidic (pH 0-1.5) Acidithiobacillus-dominated biofilms known as snottites are found in sulfide-rich caves around the world. Given the extreme geochemistry and subsurface location of the biofilms, we hypothesized that snottite Acidithiobacillus populations would be genetically isolated. We therefore investigated biogeographic relationships among snottite Acidithiobacillus spp. separated by geographic distances ranging from meters to 1000s of kilometers. We determined genetic relationships among the populations using techniques with three levels of resolution: (i) 16S rRNA gene sequencing, (ii) 16S-23S intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing and (iii) multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST). We also used metagenomics to compare functional gene characteristics of select populations. Based on 16S rRNA genes, snottites in Italy and Mexico are dominated by different sulfur-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus spp. Based on ITS sequences, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strains from different cave systems in Italy are genetically distinct. Based on MLST of isolates from Italy, genetic distance is positively correlated with geographic distance both among and within caves. However, metagenomics revealed that At. thiooxidans populations from different cave systems in Italy have different sulfur oxidation pathways and potentially other significant differences in metabolic capabilities. In light of those genomic differences, we argue that the observed correlation between genetic and geographic distance among snottite Acidithiobacillus populations is partially explained by an evolutionary model in which separate cave systems were stochastically colonized by different ancestral surface populations, which then continued to diverge and adapt in situ. © 2016 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

	abstract = {Bacterial infections cause severe medical problems worldwide, resulting in considerable death and loss of capital. With the ever-increasing rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the lack of development of new antibiotics, research on metal-based antimicrobial therapy has now gained pace. Metal ions are essential for survival, but can be highly toxic to organisms if their concentrations are not strictly controlled. Through evolution, bacteria have acquired complex metal-management systems that allow them to acquire metals that they need for survival in different challenging environments while evading metal toxicity. Metalloproteins that controls these elaborate systems in the cell, and linked to key virulence factors, are promising targets for the anti-bacterial drug development. Among several metal-sensory transcriptional regulators, the ArsR–SmtB family displays greatest diversity with several distinct metal-binding and nonmetal-binding motifs that have been characterized. These prokaryotic metolloregulatory transcriptional repressors represses the expression of operons linked to stress-inducing concentrations of metal ions by directly binding to the regulatory regions of DNA, while derepression results from direct binding of metal ions by these homodimeric proteins. Many bacteria, e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis, etc., have evolved to acquire multiple metal-sensory motifs which clearly demonstrate the importance of regulating concentrations of multiple metal ions.

	abstract = {Direct revegetation, or phytostabilization, is a containment strategy for contaminant metals associated with mine tailings in semiarid regions. The weathering of sulfide ore-derived tailings frequently drives acidification that inhibits plant establishment resulting in materials prone to wind and water dispersal. The specific objective of this study was to associate pyritic mine waste acidification, characterized through pore-water chemistry analysis, with dynamic changes in microbial community diversity and phylogenetic composition, and to evaluate the influence of different treatment strategies on the control of acidification dynamics. Samples were collected from a highly instrumented one-year mesocosm study that included the following treatments: 1) unamended tailings control; 2) tailings amended with 15% compost; and 3) the 15% compost-amended tailings planted with Atriplex lentiformis. Tailings samples were collected at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months and pore water chemistry was monitored as an indicator of acidification and weathering processes. Results confirmed that the acidification process for pyritic mine tailings is associated with a temporal progression of bacterial and archaeal phylotypes from pH sensitive Thiobacillus and Thiomonas to communities dominated by Leptospirillum and Ferroplasma. Pore-water chemistry indicated that weathering rates were highest when Leptospirillum was most abundant. The planted treatment was most successful in disrupting the successional evolution of the Fe/S-oxidizing community. Plant establishment stimulated growth of plant-growth-promoting heterotrophic phylotypes and controlled the proliferation of lithoautotrophic Fe/S-oxidizers. The results suggest the potential for eco-engineering a microbial inoculum to stimulate plant establishment and inhibit proliferation of the most efficient Fe/S-oxidizing phylotypes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Microbiological Fe(II) oxidation in emergent acid mine drainage (AMD) at the terrestrial surface, and continued precipitation of biogenic Fe(III) can lead to massive deposits of Fe(III) phases. Fe(II) oxidizing bacteria that mediate Fe(III) deposition are challenged to continue to metabolize despite burial in these Fe(III) phases, which increases the distance from the sediment-water interface where O2 is most readily available to support Fe(II) oxidation. Microbial communities associated with such deposits vary little with depth, indicating that the associated organisms can adapt to the physicochemical changes associated with Fe(III) deposition. A stable Alicyclobacillacea bacterium-containing culture (A06) was obtained under Fe(III) reducing conditions, and was also capable of aerobic growth with Fe(II) or glucose as electron donors. To evaluate the influence of Fe(III) mineralogy and O2 availability on microbial activities in an iron mound setting, we incubated the A06 culture in agarose-solidified suspensions of Fe(III) phases that mimicked the Fe(III) deposits. During the incubations, we measured O2 and Fe(II) concentrations at various depth intervals within these “artificial cores.” In incubations that included goethite, an Fe(II) oxidation front preceded maximal O2 diffusion into the incubations, indicating that Fe(II) oxidation could occur at extremely low O2 concentrations. This finding is consistent with previous field measurements. Computational modeling of activities in the incubations indicated that Fe(II) oxidation is partially controlled by diffusive O2 availability as well as Fe(II) diffusion, which may be influenced by the mineralogy of Fe(III) phases where Fe(II) oxidation is occurring. In incubations amended with glucose, schwertmannite-Fe(III) reduction occurred despite available O2, which is also consistent with previous field measurements. Our results indicate that Fe metabolism may be more heavily influenced by the mineralogical context in which activity occurs than the availability of O2. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Petroleum refining and process engineering is constantly changing. No new refineries are being built, but companies all over the world are still expanding or re-purposing huge percentages of their refineries every year, year after year. Rather than building entirely new plants, companies are spending billions of dollars in the research and development of new processes that can save time and money by being more efficient and environmentally safer. Biodesulfurization is one of those processes, and nowhere else it is covered more thoroughly or with more up-to-date research of the new advances than in this new volume from Wiley-Scrivener. Crude oil consists of hydrocarbons, along with other minerals and trace elements. Sulfur is the most abundant element after carbon and hydrogen, then comes after it nitrogen, and they usually concentrated in the higher boiling fractions of the crude oil. The presence of sulfur compounds causes the corrosion of refining facilities and catalysts poisoning. Moreover, the presence of nitrogen-compounds directly impacts the refining processes via; poisoning the cracking catalysts and inhibiting the hydrodesulfurization catalysts. In addition, both have bad impacts on the environment, throughout the sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions. Removing this sulfur and nitrogen from the refining process protects equipment and the environment and creates a more efficient and cost-effective process. Besides the obvious benefits to biodesulfurization, there are new regulations in place within the industry with which companies will, over the next decade or longer, spend literally tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars to comply. Whether for the veteran engineer needing to update his or her library, the beginning engineer just learning about biodesulfurization, or even the student in a chemical engineering class, this outstanding new volume is a must-have. Especially it covers also the bioupgrading of crude oil and its fractions, biodenitrogenation technology and application of nanotechnology on both bio-desulfurization and denitrogenation technologies. © 2018 Scrivener Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {Due to the persistence of metals in the ecosystem and their threat to all living organisms, effects of heavy metal on soil microbial communities were widely studied. However, little was known about the interactions among microorganisms in heavy metal-contaminated soils. In the present study, microbial communities in Non (CON), moderately (CL) and severely (CH) contaminated soils were investigated through high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16s rRNA gene amplicons, and networks were constructed to show the interactions among microbes. Results showed that the microbial community composition was significantly, while the microbial diversity was not significantly affected by heavy metal contamination. Bacteria showed various response to heavy metals. Bacteria that positively correlated with Cd, e.g. Acidobacteria_Gp and Proteobacteria_thiobacillus, had more links between nodes and more positive interactions among microbes in CL- and CH-networks, while bacteria that negatively correlated with Cd, e.g. Longilinea, Gp2 and Gp4 had fewer network links and more negative interactions in CL and CH-networks. Unlike bacteria, members of the archaeal domain, i.e. phyla Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, class Thermoprotei and order Thermoplasmatales showed only positive correlation with Cd and had more network interactions in CH-networks. The present study indicated that (i) the microbial community composition, as well as network interactions was shift to strengthen adaptability of microorganisms to heavy metal contamination, (ii) archaea were resistant to heavy metal contamination and may contribute to the adaption to heavy metals. It was proposed that the contribution might be achieved either by improving environment conditions or by cooperative interactions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, three pure cultures (V6, V8 and M8) and four enrichment cultures (14C, L2-21, L4-9 and L6-11) from low pH, high saline environments were characterized for their ability to oxidize soluble iron and inorganic sulfur in the presence of increasing concentrations of chloride ion. The mixed cultures 14C and L2-21 contained predominantly Acidihalobacter and Acidithiobacillus spp., respectively, while L4-9 and L6-11 predominantly contained Ferroplasma spp. Cultures V6, V8, 14C and L2-21 were assessed for their ability to oxidize 1% pyrite at 9, 15 and 30 g/L chloride ion. Results showed that pure cultures V6 and V8 and mixed culture 14C were able to oxidize pyrite at chloride ion concentrations of 30 g/L, which is higher than the chloride concentration found in seawater (19 g/L). L2-21 was unable to oxidise pyrite, possibly due to the predominant presence of sulfur oxidizing microorganisms in the mixed culture.

	abstract = {Pyrite (FeS2) is the most abundant sulfide mineral on Earth and represents a significant reservoir of reduced iron and sulfur both today and in the geologic past. In modern environments, oxidative transformations of pyrite and other metal sulfides play a key role in terrestrial element partitioning with broad impacts to contaminant mobility and the formation of acid mine drainage systems. Although the role of aerobic micro-organisms in pyrite oxidation under acidic-pH conditions is well known, to date there is very little known about the capacity for aerobic micro-organisms to oxidize pyrite at circumneutral pH. Here, we describe two enrichment cultures, obtained from pyrite-bearing subsurface sediments, that were capable of sustained cell growth linked to pyrite oxidation and sulfate generation at neutral pH. The cultures were dominated by two Rhizobiales species (Bradyrhizobium sp. and Mesorhizobium sp.) and a Ralstonia species. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and genome reconstruction indicated the presence of Fe and S oxidation pathways in these organisms, and the presence of a complete Calvin–Benson–Bassham CO2 fixation system in the Bradyrhizobium sp. Oxidation of pyrite resulted in thin (30–50 nm) coatings of amorphous Fe(III) oxide on the pyrite surface, with no other secondary Fe or S phases detected by electron microscopy or X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Rates of microbial pyrite oxidation were approximately one order of magnitude higher than abiotic rates. These results demonstrate the ability of aerobic microbial activity to accelerate pyrite oxidation and expand the potential contribution of micro-organisms to continental sulfide mineral weathering around the time of the Great Oxidation Event to include neutral-pH environments. In addition, our findings have direct implications for the geochemistry of modern sedimentary environments, including stimulation of the early stages of acid mine drainage formation and mobilization of pyrite-associated metals. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Anaerobic, mesophilic, and cellulolytic Clostridium papyrosolvens produces an efficient cellulolytic extracellular complex named cellulosome that hydrolyzes plant cell wall polysaccharides into simple sugars. Its genome harbors two long cellulosomal clusters: cip-cel operon encoding major cellulosome components (including scaffolding) and xyl-doc gene cluster encoding hemicellulases. Compared with works on cip-cel operon, there are much fewer studies on xyl-doc mainly due to its rare location in cellulolytic clostridia. Sequence analysis of xyl-doc revealed that it harbors a 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) which potentially plays a role in the regulation of downstream gene expression. Here, we analyzed the function of 5′-UTR of xyl-doc cluster in C. papyrosolvens in vivo via transformation technology developed in this study. Results: In this study, we firstly developed an electrotransformation method for C. papyrosolvens DSM 2782 before the analysis of 5′-UTR of xyl-doc cluster. In the optimized condition, a field with an intensity of 7.5-9.0 kV/cm was applied to a cuvette (0.2 cm gap) containing a mixture of plasmid and late cell suspended in exponential phase to form a 5 ms pulse in a sucrose-containing buffer. Afterwards, the putative promoter and the 5′-UTR of xyl-doc cluster were determined by sequence alignment. It is indicated that xyl-doc possesses a long conservative 5′-UTR with a complex secondary structure encompassing at least two perfect stem-loops which are potential candidates for controlling the transcriptional termination. In the last step, we employed an oxygen-independent flavin-based fluorescent protein (FbFP) as a quantitative reporter to analyze promoter activity and 5′-UTR function in vivo. It revealed that 5′-UTR significantly blocked transcription of downstream genes, but corn stover can relieve its suppression. Conclusions: In the present study, our results demonstrated that 5′-UTR of the cellulosomal xyl-doc cluster blocks the transcriptional activity of promoter. However, some substrates, such as corn stover, can relieve the effect of depression of 5′-UTR.

	abstract = {Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria from the genera Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrorhabdus and Thiomicrospira are common, sometimes dominant, isolates from sulfidic habitats including hydrothermal vents, soda and salt lakes and marine sediments. Their genome sequences confirm their membership in a deeply branching clade of the Gammaproteobacteria. Several adaptations to heterogeneous habitats are apparent. Their genomes include large numbers of genes for sensing and responding to their environment (EAL- and GGDEF-domain proteins and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) despite their small sizes (2.1–3.1 Mbp). An array of sulfur-oxidizing complexes are encoded, likely to facilitate these organisms' use of multiple forms of reduced sulfur as electron donors. Hydrogenase genes are present in some taxa, including group 1d and 2b hydrogenases in Hydrogenovibrio marinus and H. thermophilus MA2-6, acquired via horizontal gene transfer. In addition to high-affinity cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase, some also encode cytochrome bd-type quinol oxidase or ba3-type cytochrome c oxidase, which could facilitate growth under different oxygen tensions, or maintain redox balance. Carboxysome operons are present in most, with genes downstream encoding transporters from four evolutionarily distinct families, which may act with the carboxysomes to form CO2 concentrating mechanisms. These adaptations to habitat variability likely contribute to the cosmopolitan distribution of these organisms. © 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the rationale and implementation of a suite of software in the data management, processing, and statistical analysis used towards establishing reliable microbial community compositions, predictive functions, and other useful downstream bioinformatics analyses, using NGS data generated by the Illumina Miseq targeted metagenomics approach. This chapter also emphasizes the importance of using multiple taxonomic databases and software to obtain a comprehensive microbial community composition and associated functional profiles. We have used previously unpublished 16S rRNA amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) dataset of lithobiont communities (rock-dwelling microorganisms) of the Untersee Oasis, Antarctica, as an example of microbial communities in an atypical environment. The bioinformatics workflow includes “Module A” which describes obtaining the NGS files from purified lithobiont metacommunity DNA; “Module B” elaborates the steps involved in processing and assessing the sequence quality, and subsequent sequence alignment against publicly available microbial taxonomic databases (i.e. Greengenes and SILVA), to designate identities to a list of operational taxonomic units representing the microbial communities. Lastly, “Module C” presents the microbial community compositions at the highest taxonomic levels, diversity within and between samples, predictive functional attributes, and Co-Occurrence Network (CoNet) analysis of microbial communities. The results generated from this example demonstrated that the lithobiont communities from Lake Untersee had high abundances of Aliihoeflea and Sphingomonas, whereas Acinetobacter and Paenibacillus were dominant in Lake Obersee. Predictive functional profiles of both communities showed high abundances of genes designated for membrane transport and bacterial secretion systems, amino acid metabolism, and UV tolerance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Molecular mechanisms of chemolithotrophic tetrathionate oxidation are not clearly understood. Here we used transposon(Tn5-mob)-insertion mutagenesis to search for novel tetrathionate oxidation genes in the facultatively chemolithoautotrophic betaproteobacterium Advenella kashmirensis that not only oxidizes tetrathionate, but also produces the same as an intermediate during thiosulfate oxidation. Genome-wide random insertion of Tn5-mob occurred at a frequency of one per 104 donor E. coli cells. A library of 8000 transconjugants yielded five tetrathionate-oxidation-impaired mutants, of which, the one named Ak_Tn_16 was studied here in detail. When grown chemolithoautotrophically on thiosulfate, Ak_Tn_16 converted the total thiosulfate supplied to equivalent amount of tetrathionate, exactly in the same way as the wild type. It could not, however, oxidize the intermediary tetrathionate to sulfate; Ak_Tn_16 could not also oxidize tetrathionate when it was supplied as the starting chemolithotrophic substrate. In the Ak_Tn_16 genome, Tn5-mob was found to have transposed in a novel soxO gene, located just-upstream of soxB, within the sox gene cluster. SoxO was predicted, via iterative threading assembly simulation, to be a glutathione-disulfide (GSSG) reductase. When Ak_Tn_16 was grown in tetrathionate-based chemolithoautotrophic medium supplemented with reduced glutathione (GSH) its tetrathionate-oxidation deficiency, remarkably, was ameliorated. Implications for a key role of GSH in tetrathionate oxidation are discussed in the light of other molecular evidences available for A. kashmirensis. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The textile and dyeing industries are major sources of environmental water pollution all over the world. The textile wastewater effluents discharged into rivers often appear dark red-purple in color due to azo dyes, which can be transformed into carcinogenic aromatic amines. The chemicals used in dyeing are not readily degraded in nature and thus precipitate in river sediment. However, little is known about how dyeing chemicals affect river sediment and river water or how long they persist because they are difficult to monitor. To assess undetectable dyes and byproducts in river sediments, we evaluated the potential of river sediment bacteria to degrade dyes and aromatic amines. We describe the natural remediation of river sediment long-contaminated by textile dyeing effluent. After cessation of wastewater discharge, the dye-degradation potential decreased, and the aromatic amine–degradation potential increased initially and then declined over time. The changes in degradation potential were consistent with changes in the sediment bacterial community. The transition occurred on the order of years. Our data strongly suggest that dyes remained in the river sediment and that aromatic amines were produced even in transparent- and no longer colored–river water, but these chemicals were degraded by the changing sediment bacteria. Time-course monitoring of the degradation activities of key bacteria thus enables assessment of the fate of dye pollutants in river sediments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {At hydrothermal vent sites, chimneys consisting of sulfides, sulfates, and oxides are formed upon contact of reduced hydrothermal fluids with oxygenated seawater. The walls and surfaces of these chimneys are an important habitat for vent-associated microorganisms. We used community proteogenomics to investigate and compare the composition, metabolic potential and relative in situ protein abundance of microbial communities colonizing two actively venting hydrothermal chimneys from the Manus Basin back-arc spreading center (Papua New Guinea). We identified overlaps in the in situ functional profiles of both chimneys, despite differences in microbial community composition and venting regime. Carbon fixation on both chimneys seems to have been primarily mediated through the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle and fueled by sulfur-oxidation, while the abundant metabolic potential for hydrogen oxidation and carbon fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was hardly utilized. Notably, the highly diverse microbial community colonizing the analyzed black smoker chimney had a highly redundant metabolic potential. In contrast, the considerably less diverse community colonizing the diffusely venting chimney displayed a higher metabolic versatility. An increased diversity on the phylogenetic level is thus not directly linked to an increased metabolic diversity in microbial communities that colonize hydrothermal chimneys. © 2018 Pjevac, Meier, Markert, Hentschker, Schweder, Becher, Gruber-Vodicka, Richter, Bach, Amann and Meyerdierks.},

	abstract = {The limited database of acidophilic or acidotolerant electrochemically active microorganisms prevents advancements on microbial fuel cells (MFCs) operated under low pH. In this study, three MFCs were used to enrich cathodic biofilms using acid mine drainage (AMD) sediments as inoculum. Linear sweep voltammetry showed cathodic current plateaus of 5.5 (± 0.7) mA at about − 170 mV vs Ag/AgCl and 8.5 (± 0.9) mA between − 500 mV to − 450 mV vs Ag/AgCl for biofilms developed on small graphite fiber brushes. After gamma irradiation, biocathodes exhibited a decrease in current density approaching that of abiotic controls. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed six-fold lower charge transfer resistance with viable biofilm. Pyrosequencing data showed that Proteobacteria and Firmicutes dominated the biofilms. Acidithiobacillus representatives were enriched in some biocathodes, supporting the potential importance of these known iron and sulfur oxidizers as cathodic biocatalysts. Other acidophilic chemolithoautotrophs identified included Sulfobacillus and Leptospirillum species. The presence of chemoautotrophs was consistent with functional capabilities predicted by PICRUSt related to carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotic microorganisms. Acidophilic or acidotolerant heterotrophs were also abundant; however, their contribution to cathodic performance is unknown. This study directs subsequent research efforts to particular groups of AMD-associated bacteria that are electrochemically active on cathodes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Spatial and temporal description of the microbial community could be relevant for better comprehension of copper extraction process and help in the development of operative procedures to improve the metal extraction. We performed metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes analyses on samples from Escondida mine bioleaching heap and laboratory columns tests. Archaeal community structure in samples was assessed using three pairs of Archaea-specific primers, and results were highly depending on the primers pairs used. Similarly, three pairs of Bacteria-specific primers were used to assess the bacterial community. Moreover, according to the metagenomics analysis, At. thiooxidans, F. acidarmanus, Leptospirillum spp., Acidiphilium sp. JA12-A1, Acidiphilium spp., At. ferrivorans, and Leptospirillum ferriphilum were the most representative microorganisms. The repercussion of the different methodologies and outputs in the characterization of the bioleaching microbial community is discussed.

	abstract = {Since 1998 multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been widely used for molecular characterization of bacteria and fungi because of its molecular and technical advantages. MLST data are highly variable and informative, universally comparable, easily validated, accessible through the Internet, and transferable across researchers. MLST data are currently used not only in epidemiological investigations at global and local scales but also in studies of pathogen population dynamics, pathogenicity, and molecular evolution. Here, we review several key aspects of MLST molecular design and development in relation to new sequencing technologies; database submission, storing, access, and management; advantages and disadvantages compared to other typing techniques; statistical methods of analysis with special emphasis on coalescent-based approaches; and their application to population dynamics, epidemiological inferences, species diagnosis, and phylogenetics or phylogenomics. The increasing speed, quantity and quality, and reduced cost of gene and genome nucleotide sequencing, together with improved web-based databases, analytical tools, and rising computer power, will lead to a continued expansion in the use of MLST and its integration with cost-effective pathogen genome sequencing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Here, we report about a unique aquatic fungus Mucor hiemalisEH8 that can remove toxic ionic mercury from water by intracellular accumulation and reduction into elemental mercury (Hg0). EH8 was isolated from a microbial biofilm grown in sulfidic-reducing spring water sourced at a Marching's site located downhill from hop cultivation areas with a history of mercury use. A thorough biodiversity survey and mercury-removal function analyses were undertaken in an area of about 200 km2 in Bavaria (Germany) to find the key biofilm and microbe for mercury removal. After a systematic search using metal removal assays we identified Marching spring's biofilm out of 18 different sulfidic springs' biofilms as the only one that was capable of removing ionic Hg from water. EH8 was selected, due to its molecular biological identification as the key microorganism of this biofilm with the capability of mercury removal, and cultivated as a pure culture on solid and in liquid media to produce germinating sporangiospores. They removed 99% of mercury from water within 10–48 h after initial exposure to Hg(II). Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated occurrence of intracellular mercury in germinating sporangiospores exposed to mercury. Not only associated with intracellular components, but mercury was also found to be released and deposited as metallic-shiny nanospheres. Electron-dispersive x-ray analysis of such a nanosphere confirmed presence of mercury by the HgMα peak at 2.195 keV. Thus, a first aquatic eukaryotic microbe has been found that is able to grow even at low temperature under sulfur-reducing conditions with promising performance in mercury removal to safeguard our environment from mercury pollution. © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {To date, information on plasmid analysis in Pandoraea spp. is scarce. To address the gap of knowledge on this, the complete sequences of eight plasmids from Pandoraea spp. namely Pandoraea faecigallinarum DSM 23572T (pPF72-1, pPF72-2), Pandoraea oxalativorans DSM 23570T (pPO70-1, pPO70-2, pPO70-3, pPO70-4), Pandoraea vervacti NS15 (pPV15) and Pandoraea apista DSM 16535T (pPA35) were studied for the first time in this study. The information on plasmid sequences in Pandoraea spp. is useful as the sequences did not match any known plasmid sequence deposited in public databases. Replication genes were not identified in some plasmids, a situation that has led to the possibility of host interaction involvement. Some plasmids were also void of par genes and intriguingly, repA gene was also not discovered in these plasmids. This further leads to the hypothesis of host-plasmid interaction. Plasmid stabilization/stability protein-encoding genes were observed in some plasmids but were not established for participating in plasmid segregation. Toxin-antitoxin systems MazEF, VapBC, RelBE, YgiT-MqsR, HigBA, and ParDE were identified across the plasmids and their presence would improve plasmid maintenance. Conjugation genes were identified portraying the conjugation ability amongst Pandoraea plasmids. Additionally, we found a shared region amongst some of the plasmids that consists of conjugation genes. The identification of genes involved in replication, segregation, toxin-antitoxin systems and conjugation, would aid the design of drugs to prevent the survival or transmission of plasmids carrying pathogenic properties. Additionally, genes conferring virulence and antibiotic resistance were identified amongst the plasmids. The observed features in the plasmids shed light on the Pandoraea spp. as opportunistic pathogens. © 2016 Yong, Tee, Yin and Chan.},

	abstract = {As one of the most intrinsically reactive amino acids, cysteine carries a variety of important biochemical functions, including catalysis and redox regulation. Discovery and characterization of cysteines with heightened reactivity will help annotate protein functions. Chemical proteomic methods have been used to quantitatively profile cysteine reactivity in native proteomes, showing a strong correlation between the chemical reactivity of a cysteine and its functionality; however, the relationship between the cysteine reactivity and its local sequence has not yet been systematically explored. Herein, we report a machine learning method, sbPCR (sequence-based prediction of cysteine reactivity), which combines the basic local alignment search tool, truncated composition of k-spaced amino acid pair analysis, and support vector machine to predict cysteines with hyper-reactivity based on only local sequence features. Using a benchmark set compiled from hyper-reactive cysteines in human proteomes, our method can achieve a prediction accuracy of 98%, a precision of 95%, and a recall ratio of 89%. We utilized these governing features of local sequence motifs to expand the prediction to potential hyper-reactive cysteines in other proteomes deposited in the UniProt database. We validated our predictions in Escherichia coli by activity-based protein profiling and discovered a hyper-reactive cysteine from a functionally uncharacterized protein, YecH. Biochemical analysis suggests that the hyper-reactive cysteine might be involved in metal binding. Our computational method provides a large inventory of potential hyper-reactive cysteines in proteomes and is highly complementary to other experimental approaches to guide systematic annotation of protein functions in the postgenome era. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a chemolithoautotrophic Gram-negative bacterium, has a remarkable ability to obtain energy from ferrous iron oxidation at pH 2. Several metalloproteins have been described as being involved in this respiratory chain coupling iron oxidation with oxygen reduction. However, their properties and physiological functions remain largely unknown, preventing a clear understanding of the global mechanism. In this work, we focus on two metalloproteins of this respiratory pathway, a diheme cytochrome c4 (Cyt c4) and a green copper protein (AcoP) of unknown function. We first demonstrate the formation of a complex between these two purified proteins, which allows homogeneous intermolecular electron-transfer in solution. We then mimic the physiological interaction between the two partners by replacing one at a time with electrodes displaying different chemical functionalities. From the electrochemical behavior of individual proteins, we show that, while electron transfer on AcoP requires weak electrostatic interaction, electron transfer on Cyt c4 tolerates different charge and hydrophobicity conditions, suggesting a pivotal role of this protein in the metabolic chain. The electrochemical study of the proteins incubated together demonstrates an intermolecular electron transfer involving the protein complex, in which AcoP is reduced through the high potential heme of Cyt c4. Modelling of the electrochemical signals at different scan rates allows us to estimate the rate constant of this intermolecular electron transfer in the range of a few s-1. Possible routes for electron transfer in the acidophilic bacterium are deduced. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Glycosylation is a chemical transformation that is centrally important in all glycoscience and related technologies. Catalysts offering good control over reactivity and selectivity in synthetic glycosylations are much sought. The enzymes responsible for glycosylations in natural biosynthesis are sugar-nucleotide-dependent (Leloir) glycosyltransferases. Discovery-oriented synthesis and pilot batch production of oligosaccharides and glycosylated natural products have previously relied on Leloir glycosyltransferases. However, despite their perceived synthetic utility, Leloir glycosyltransferases are yet to see widespread application in industrial biocatalysis. Here we show progress and limitations in the development of Leloir glycosyltransferases into robust biocatalytic systems for use in glycosylations for chemical production. Obtaining highly active and stable (whole-cell) catalysts that can promote the desired glycosylation(s) coupled to an in situ sugar nucleotide supply remains a difficult problem. Optimizing glycosyltransferase cascade reactions for high process efficiency is another. Glycosylations of some natural products (e.g., flavonoids, terpenoids) involve acceptor substrate solubility as a special challenge for biocatalytic process design. Strategies to overcome these problems are illustrated from examples of integrated biocatalytic process development with this class of enzymes. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Although neutral mine drainage is the less frequent subject of the interest than acid mine drainage, it can have adverse environmental effects caused mainly by precipitation of dissolved Fe. The aim of the study was to characterize the composition of bacterial population in environment with high concentration of iron and sulfur compounds represented by neutral mine drainage water of Elizabeth’s shaft, Slovinky (Slovakia). Direct microscopic observations, cultivation methods, and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons were used to examine the bacterial population. Microscopic observations identified iron–oxidizing Proteobacteria of the genera Gallionella and Leptothrix which occurrence was not changed during the years 2008–2014. Using 454 pyrosequencing, there were identified members of 204 bacterial genera that belonged to 25 phyla. Proteobacteria (69.55%), followed by Chloroflexi (10.31%) and Actinobacteria (4.24%) dominated the bacterial community. Genera Azotobacter (24.52%) and Pseudomonas (14.15%), followed by iron–oxidizing Proteobacteria Dechloromonas (11%) and Methyloversatilis (8.53%) were most abundant within bacterial community. Typical sulfur bacteria were detected with lower frequency, e.g., Desulfobacteraceae (0.25%), Desulfovibrionaceae (0.16%), or Desulfobulbaceae (0.11%). Our data indicate that the composition of bacterial community of the Elizabeth’s shaft drainage water reflects observed neutral pH, high level of iron and sulfur ions in this aquatic habitat. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Microbes are a major source of antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and other bioactive compounds. The production of many specialized microbial metabolites is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). A challenge associated with natural product discovery is that many BGCs are not expressed under laboratory growth conditions. Here we report a genome-mining approach to discover BGCs with luxRtype quorum sensing (QS) genes, which code for regulatory proteins that control gene expression. Our results show that BGCs linked to genes coding for LuxR-like proteins are widespread in Proteobacteria. In addition, we show that associations between luxR homolog genes and BGCs have evolved independently many times, with functionally diverse gene clusters. Overall, these clusters may provide a source of new natural products for which there is some understanding about how to elicit production. IMPORTANCE Bacteria biosynthesize specialized metabolites with a variety of ecological functions, including defense against other microbes. Genes that code for specialized metabolite biosynthetic enzymes are frequently clustered together. These BGCs are often regulated by a transcription factor encoded within the cluster itself. These pathway-specific regulators respond to a signal or indirectly through other means of environmental sensing. Many specialized metabolites are not produced under laboratory growth conditions, and one reason for this issue is that laboratory growth media lack environmental cues necessary for BGC expression. Here, we report a bioinformatics study that reveals that BGCs are frequently linked to genes coding for LuxR family QS-responsive transcription factors in the phylum Proteobacteria. The products of these luxR homolog-associated gene clusters may serve as a practical source of bioactive metabolites. © 2018 Ward et al.},

	abstract = {The extensive application of fertilizers for growing rice results in a large input of nitrogen into paddy soils. During rice growth, iron is exposed to periodic transition under different redox conditions. Nitrate (NO3-) reduction coupled to Fe(ii) oxidation (NRCFO) links the iron and nitrogen cycles. However, little is known about the biogeochemical mechanism and microorganisms involved in NRCFO in paddy soil. In the present study, we isolated an anaerobic, NO3--reducing Fe(ii) oxidizer known as strain Paddy-1 from paddy soil. After 6 days of culture in 5 mM acetate, this strain reduced 97% of NO3- and oxidized 86% of Fe(ii) from initial concentrations of 9.3 and 5.1 mM, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed strain Paddy-1 in a clade within the order Rhodocyclales. In accordance with other NRCFO species, Fe(iii) oxides produced by strain Paddy-1 were in the form of amorphous Fe(iii) oxides. The reported draft genome of strain Paddy-1 predicts the presence of genes involved in denitrification, outer membrane electron transport, and iron homeostasis as well as candidate Fe(ii) oxidation genes. The physiological and genomic information on this strain provide a basis for investigating the mechanism of NRCFO in microorganisms from paddy soil. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The increasing number of metagenomic and genomic sequences has dramatically improved our understanding of microbial diversity, yet our ability to infer metabolic capabilities in such datasets remains challenging. We describe the Multigenomic Entropy Based Score pipeline (MEBS), a software platform designed to evaluate, compare, and infer complex metabolic pathways in large "omic" datasets, including entire biogeochemical cycles. MEBS is open source and available through https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/metagenome Pfam score. To demonstrate its use, we modeled the sulfur cycle by exhaustively curating the molecular and ecological elements involved (compounds, genes, metabolic pathways, and microbial taxa). This information was reduced to a collection of 112 characteristic Pfam protein domains and a list of complete-sequenced sulfur genomes. Using the mathematical framework of relative entropy (H'), we quantitatively measured the enrichment of these domains among sulfur genomes. The entropy of each domain was used both to build up a final score that indicates whether a (meta)genomic sample contains the metabolic machinery of interest and to propose marker domains in metagenomic sequences such as DsrC (PF04358). MEBS was benchmarked with a dataset of 2107 non-redundant microbial genomes from RefSeq and 935 metagenomes from MG-RAST. Its performance, reproducibility, and robustness were evaluated using several approaches, including random sampling, linear regression models, receiver operator characteristic plots, and the area under the curve metric (AUC). Our results support the broad applicability of this algorithm to accurately classify (AUC = 0.985) hard-to-culture genomes (e.g., Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator), previously characterized ones, and metagenomic environments such as hydrothermal vents, or deep-sea sediment. Our benchmark indicates that an entropy-based score can capture the metabolic machinery of interest and can be used to efficiently classify large genomic and metagenomic datasets, including uncultivated/unexplored taxa. © The Author 2017.},

Here we present the isolation and analysis of Pseudomonas silesiensis sp. nov. strain A3T isolated from peaty soil used in a biological wastewater treatment plant exploited by a pesticide packaging company. Phylogenetic MLSA analysis of 4 housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoD and rpoB), complete genome sequence comparison (ANIb, Tetranucleotide identity, digital DDH), FAME analysis, and other biochemical tests indicate the A3T strain (type strain PCM 2856T = DSM 103370T) differs significantly from the closest relative species and therefore represents a new species within the Pseudomonas genus. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis of the complete sequenced genome showed that it consists of 6,823,539 bp with a 59.58 mol% G + C content and does not contain any additional plasmids.

	abstract = {Lysinibacillus sphaericus strain OT4b.31 is a bacterium widely applied in bioremediation processes of hydrocarbon and metal polluted environments. In this study, we identified the molecular mechanism underlying the Pb2+ and Cr6+ resistance. Metal uptake and temporal transcription patterns of metal resistance operons were evaluated using reverse-transcribed quantitative PCR amplification. The function of the resistance determinants was studied applying docking and in silico mutagenesis methods. The results revealed that the adaptation of Lysinibacillus sphaericus OT4b.31 to elevated levels of lead and chromium involves the pbr and chr operons which comprise a transcriptional regulatory component (pbrR and chrB) and efflux ATPases (pbrA and chrA) to expel ions from the cytoplasm. Expression of metal resistance genes was constitutive and specifically inducible to the exposure of Pb2+ and Cr6+. The simultaneous presence of cations didn't affect the bioaccumulation of metals, evidencing the multimetal resistance of L. sphaericus. Docking analysis revealed the key metal-protein interactions and the conformational changes after metal or ATP binding. Results showed that residues with aromatic rings or imidazole in the catalytic domain are crucial for metal binding and achievement of the function. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific mechanism for lead and chromium resistance in Lysinibacillus genus. From the findings of this study, it is possible to suggest the bacterium as a suitable candidate for rapid toxic metals bioremediation processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Acquisition of energy is central to life. In addition to the synthesis of ATP, organisms need energy for the establishment and maintenance of a transmembrane difference in electrochemical potential, in order to import and export metabolites or to their motility. The membrane potential is established by a variety of membrane bound respiratory complexes. In this work we explored the diversity of membrane respiratory chains and the presence of the different enzyme complexes in the several phyla of life. We performed taxonomic profiles of the several membrane bound respiratory proteins and complexes evaluating the presence of their respective coding genes in all species deposited in KEGG database. We evaluated 26 quinone reductases, 5 quinol:electron carriers oxidoreductases and 18 terminal electron acceptor reductases. We further included in the analyses enzymes performing redox or decarboxylation driven ion translocation, ATP synthase and transhydrogenase and we also investigated the electron carriers that perform functional connection between the membrane complexes, quinones or soluble proteins. Our results bring a novel, broad and integrated perspective of membrane bound respiratory complexes and thus of the several energetic metabolisms of living systems.

	abstract = {Many heterotrophic bacteria contain sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) and persulfide dioxygenase (PDO) genes. It is unclear how these enzymes cooperate to oxidise sulfide in bacteria. Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134 contains a gene cluster of sqr and pdo, and their functions were analysed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant E. coli cells with SQR and PDO rapidly oxidised sulfide to thiosulfate and sulfite. The SQR also contains a DUF442 domain that was shown to have rhodanese activities. E. coli cells with PDO and SQR-C94S, an active site mutant of the rhodanese domain, oxidised sulfide to thiosulfate with transitory accumulation of polysulfides. Cellular and enzymatic evidence showed that DUF442 speeds up the reaction of polysulfides with glutathione to produce glutathione persulfide (GSSH). Thus, SQR oxidises sulfide to polysulfides; rhodanese enhances the reaction of polysulfides with glutathione to produce GSSH; PDO oxidises GSSH to sulfite; sulfite spontaneously reacts with polysulfides to generate thiosulfate. The pathway is different from the proposed mitochondrial pathway because it has polysulfides, that is, disulfide and trisulfide, as intermediates. The data demonstrated that heterotrophic bacteria with SQR and PDO can rapidly oxidise sulfide to thiosulfate and sulfite, providing the foundation for using heterotrophic bacteria with SQR and PDO for sulfide bioremediation. © 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Respiratory infections by bacteria of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality among cystic fibrosis patients, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. In the present work we have studied the B. cenocepacia protein BCAL2958, a member of the OmpA-like family of proteins, demonstrated as highly immunogenic in other pathogens and capable of eliciting strong host immune responses. The encoding gene was cloned and the protein, produced as a 6× His-tagged derivative, was used to produce polyclonal antibodies. Bioinformatics analyses led to the identification of sequences encoding proteins with a similarity higher than 96 % to BCAL2958 in all the publicly available Bcc genomes. Furthermore, using the antibody it was experimentally demonstrated that this protein is produced by all the 12 analyzed strains from 7 Bcc species. In addition, results are also presented showing the presence of anti-BCAL2958 antibodies in sera from cystic fibrosis patients with a clinical record of respiratory infection by Bcc, and the ability of the purified protein to in vitro stimulate neutrophils. The widespread production of the protein by Bcc members, together with its ability to stimulate the immune system and the detection of circulating antibodies in patients with a documented record of Bcc infection strongly suggest that the protein is a potential candidate for usage in preventive therapies of infections by Bcc. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The acidithiobacilli are sulfur-oxidizing acidophilic bacteria that thrive in both natural and anthropogenic low pH environments. They contribute to processes that lead to the generation of acid rock drainage in several different geoclimatic contexts, and their properties have long been harnessed for the biotechnological processing of minerals. Presently, the genus is composed of seven validated species, described between 1922 and 2015: Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, A. ferrooxidans, A. albertensis, A. caldus, A. ferrivorans, A. ferridurans, and A. ferriphilus. However, a large number of Acidithiobacillus strains and sequence clones have been obtained from a variety of ecological niches over the years, and many isolates are thought to vary in phenotypic properties and cognate genetic traits. Moreover, many isolates remain unclassified and several conflicting specific assignments muddle the picture from an evolutionary standpoint. Here we revise the phylogenetic relationships within this species complex and determine the phylogenetic species boundaries using three different typing approaches with varying degrees of resolution: 16S rRNA gene-based ribotyping, oligotyping, and multi-locus sequencing analysis (MLSA). To this end, the 580 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated to the Acidithiobacillus spp. were collected from public and private databases and subjected to a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. Oligotyping was used to profile high-entropy nucleotide positions and resolve meaningful differences between closely related strains at the 16S rRNA gene level. Due to its greater discriminatory power, MLSA was used as a proxy for genome-wide divergence in a smaller but representative set of strains. Results obtained indicate that there is still considerable unexplored diversity within this genus. At least six new lineages or phylotypes, supported by the different methods used herein, are evident within the Acidithiobacillus species complex. Although the diagnostic characteristics of these subgroups of strains are as yet unresolved, correlations to specific metadata hint to the mechanisms behind econiche-driven divergence of some of the species/phylotypes identified. The emerging phylogenetic structure for the genus outlined in this study can be used to guide isolate selection for future population genomics and evolutionary studies in this important acidophile model. © 2017 Nuñez, Moya-Beltrán, Covarrubias, Issotta, Cárdenas, González, Atavales, Acuña, Johnson and Quatrini.},

	abstract = {A large fraction (47%) of the world's uranium is mined by a technique called “In Situ Recovery” (ISR). This mining technique involves the injection of a leaching fluid (acidic or alkaline) into a uranium-bearing aquifer and the pumping of the resulting solution through cation exchange columns for the recovery of dissolved uranium. The present study reports the in-depth alterations brought to autochthonous microbial communities during acidic ISR activities. Water samples were collected from a uranium roll-front deposit that is part of an ISR mine in operation (Tortkuduk, Kazakhstan). Water samples were obtained at a depth of ca 500 m below ground level from several zones of the Uyuk aquifer following the natural redox zonation inherited from the roll front deposit, including the native mineralized orebody and both upstream and downstream adjacent locations. Samples were collected equally from both the entrance and the exit of the uranium concentration plant. Next-generation sequencing data showed that the redox gradient shaped the community structures, within the anaerobic, reduced, and oligotrophic habitats of the native aquifer zones. Acid injection induced drastic changes in the structures of these communities, with a large decrease in both cell numbers and diversity. Communities present in the acidified (pH values < 2) mining areas exhibited similarities to those present in acid mine drainage, with the dominance of Sulfobacillus sp., Leptospirillum sp. and Acidithiobacillus sp., as well as the archaean Ferroplasma sp. Communities located up- and downstream of the mineralized zone under ISR and affected by acidic fluids were blended with additional facultative anaerobic and acidophilic microorganisms. These mixed biomes may be suitable communities for the natural attenuation of ISR mining-affected subsurface through the reduction of metals and sulfate. Assessing the effect of acidification on the microbial community is critical to evaluating the potential for natural attenuation or active bioremediation strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The screening of a metagenomic library of 250,000 clones generated from a hypersaline soil (Spain) allowed us to identify a single positive clone which confers the ability to degrade N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). The sequencing of the fosmid revealed a 42,318 bp environmental insert characterized by 46 ORFs. The subcloning of these ORFs demonstrated that a single gene (hqiA) allowed AHL degradation. Enzymatic analysis using purified HqiA and HPLC/MS revealed that this protein has lactonase activity on a broad range of AHLs. The introduction of hqiA in the plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum efficiently interfered with both the synthesis of AHLs and quorum-sensing regulated functions, such as swarming motility and the production of maceration enzymes. Bioinformatic analyses highlighted that HqiA showed no sequence homology with the known prototypic AHL lactonases or acylases, thus expanding the AHL-degrading enzymes with a new family related to the cysteine hydrolase (CHase) group. The complete sequence analysis of the fosmid showed that 31 ORFs out of the 46 identified were related to Deltaproteobacteria, whilst many intercalated ORFs presented high homology with other taxa. In this sense, hqiA appeared to be assigned to the Hyphomonas genus (Alphaproteobacteria), suggesting that horizontal gene transfer had occurred. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Selenoproteins are a group of proteins which contain selenocysteine (Sec or U) in their primary structure. Selenoproteins play a critical role in antioxidant defense, hormone metabolism, immune responses and muscle development. The selenoprotein H (SELENOH) is essential in the regulation of gene expression in response to redox status and antioxidant defense. It has Sec residue located in conserved CXXU motif similar to other selenoproteins. However, exact biological function of Sec residue in SELENOH is not known in detail. Therefore, it is essential to understand the structural and functional role of Sec in SELENOH. In the present study, homology modelling and MD simulation were performed to understand the role of Sec residue in SELENOH. The modelled 3D structure of wild-SELENOH along with two mutants (Mut-U44C and Mut-41CS–SC44) was subjected to MD simulation. Based on simulation results, we demonstrate that wild-SELENOH structure is dynamically stabilized by network of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and internal residue contacts facilitated by Sec residue. In contrast, notable differences have been observed in residue contacts and stability in other two mutant structures. Additionally, docking studies revealed that 3PRGRKRK9 motif of wild-SELENOH interacts with HSE and STRE of DNA molecule as observed experimentally. Similar to earlier reports, our sequence analysis study pinpoints conserved 3PRGRKRK9 motif present in SELENOH perform dual role as AT-hook motif and NLS. Overall, the obtained results clearly illustrate Sec residue plays an important role to restore functionally active conformation of SELENOH. The present study broadened our current understanding regarding the role of selenocysteine in protein structure and function. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Gold tailings often release arsenic (As) contaminants into the surrounding environment. Microorganisms play an important role in the As cycle, whereas the effects of As on bacterial communities remain unclear. To reveal the effects of As on the diversity of bacterial communities and their As-tolerance potential, farmland soil and river sediment samples were collected at various distances from tailings in the Dandong area of northeastern China. The bacterial communities were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The membrane transport proteins ArsB and (or) ACR3 pump As(III) out of the cell to resist As toxicity. We studied the abundance and phylogeny of ArsB and ACR3 using PCR-based clone libraries and quantitative PCR. The bacterial community was divided into 10 phyla and 59 genera. The transformation from As(V) to As(III) was predominant, which was coupled with denitrification. Both ArsB and ACR3 likely evolved from different orders of Proteobacteria. The arsB gene seems to be more stable in bestowing bacteria with the capability to respond to the As concentration. Moreover, As with iron, manganese, and total organic carbon also influenced the clustering relationships of samples and bacterial distribution. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

	abstract = {Much interest has gained the biomineralization process carried out by magnetotactic bacteria. These bacteria are ubiquitous in natural environments and share the ability to passively align along the magnetic field lines and actively swim along them. This ability is due to their magnetosome chain, each magnetosome consisting on a magnetic crystal enveloped by a lipid bilayer membrane to which very unique proteins are associated. Magnetotactic bacteria exquisitely control magnetosome formation, making the magnetosomes the ideal magnetic nanoparticle of potential use in many technological applications. The difficulty to scale up magnetosome production has triggered the research on the in vitro production of biomimetic (magnetosome-like) magnetite nanoparticles. In this context, magnetosome proteins are being used to mediate such in vitro magnetite precipitation experiments. The present work reviews the knowledgement on the magnetosome proteins thought to have a role on the in vivo formation of magnetite crystals in the magnetosome, and the recombinant magnetosome proteins used in vitro to form biomimetic magnetite. It also summarizes the data provided in the literature on the biomimetic magnetite nanoparticles obtained from those in vitro experiments. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus thiooxidansCLST is an extremely acidophilic gamma-proteobacteria that was isolated from the Gorbea salt flat, an acidic hypersaline environment in northern Chile. This kind of environment is considered a terrestrial analog of ancient Martian terrains and a source of new material for biotechnological applications. A. thiooxidansplays a key role in industrial bioleaching; it has the capacity of generating and maintaining acidic conditions by producing sulfuric acid and it can also remove sulfur layers from the surface of minerals, which are detrimental for their dissolution. CLST is a strain of A. thiooxidansable to tolerate moderate chloride concentrations (up to 15 g L-1 Cl-), a feature that is quite unusual in extreme acidophilic microorganisms. Basic microbiological features and genomic properties of this biotechnologically relevant strain are described in this work. The 3,974,949 bp draft genome is arranged into 40 scaffolds of 389 contigs containing 3866 protein-coding genes and 75 RNAs encoding genes. This is the first draft genome of a halotolerant A. thiooxidansstrain. The release of the genome sequence of this strain improves representation of these extreme acidophilic Gram negative bacteria in public databases and strengthens the framework for further investigation of the physiological diversity and ecological function of A. thiooxidans populations. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The brucellae are α-Proteobacteria causing brucellosis, an important zoonosis. Although multiplying in endoplasmic reticulum-derived vacuoles, they cause no cell death, suggesting subtle but efficient use of host resources. Brucellae are amino-acid prototrophs able to grow with ammonium or use glutamate as the sole carbon–nitrogen source in vitro. They contain more than twice amino acid/peptide/polyamine uptake genes than the amino-acid auxotroph Legionella pneumophila, which multiplies in a similar vacuole, suggesting a different nutritional strategy. During these two last decades, many mutants of key actors in nitrogen metabolism (transporters, enzymes, regulators, etc.) have been described to be essential for full virulence of brucellae. Here, we review the genomic and experimental data on Brucella nitrogen metabolism and its connection with virulence. An analysis of various aspects of this metabolism (transport, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism, respiration and regulation) has highlighted differences and similarities in nitrogen metabolism with other α-Proteobacteria. Together, these data suggest that, during their intracellular life cycle, the brucellae use various nitrogen sources for biosynthesis, catabolism and respiration following a strategy that requires prototrophy and a tight regulation of nitrogen use. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

Both bioaugmentation strategies improved ammonium (NH4+-N) removal efficiencies, and the embedding strategy also exhibited satisfactory NO3−-N and total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies.

	abstract = {The composition and metabolic traits of the microbial communities acting in an innovative bioelectrochemical system were here investigated. The system, known as Oil Spill Snorkel, was recently developed to stimulate the oxidative biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in anoxic marine sediments. Next Generation Sequencing was used to describe the microbiome of the bulk sediment and of the biofilm growing attached to the surface of the electrode. The analysis revealed that sulfur cycling primarily drives the microbial metabolic activities occurring in the bioelectrochemical system. In the anoxic zone of the contaminated marine sediment, petroleum hydrocarbon degradation occurred under sulfate-reducing conditions and was lead by different families of Desulfobacterales (46% of total OTUs). Remarkably, the occurrence of filamentous Desulfubulbaceae, known to be capable to vehicle electrons deriving from sulfide oxidation to oxygen serving as a spatially distant electron acceptor, was demonstrated. Differently from the sediment, which was mostly colonized by Deltaproteobacteria, the biofilm at the anode hosted, at high extent, members of Alphaproteobacteria (59%) mostly affiliated to Rhodospirillaceae family (33%) and including several known sulfur- and sulfide-oxidizing genera. Overall, we showed the occurrence in the system of a variety of electroactive microorganisms able to sustain the contaminant biodegradation alone or by means of an external conductive support through the establishment of a bioelectrochemical connection between two spatially separated redox zones and the preservation of an efficient sulfur cycling. © 2017 Matturro, Cruz Viggi, Aulenta and Rossetti.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans known for its ubiquity in diverse acidic and sulfur-bearing environments worldwide was used as the research subject in this study. To explore the genomic fluidity and intraspecific diversity of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (A. thiooxidans) species, comparative genomics based on nine draft genomes was performed. Phylogenomic scrutiny provided first insights into the multiple groupings of these strains, suggesting that genetic diversity might be potentially correlated with their geographic distribution as well as geochemical conditions. While these strains shared a large number of common genes, they displayed differences in gene content. Functional assignment indicated that the core genome was essential for microbial basic activities such as energy acquisition and uptake of nutrients, whereas the accessory genome was thought to be involved in niche adaptation. Comprehensive analysis of their predicted central metabolism revealed that few differences were observed among these strains. Further analyses showed evidences of relevance between environmental conditions and genomic diversification. Furthermore, a diverse pool of mobile genetic elements including insertion sequences and genomic islands in all A. thiooxidans strains probably demonstrated the frequent genetic flow (such as lateral gene transfer) in the extremely acidic environments. From another perspective, these elements might endow A. thiooxidans species with capacities to withstand the chemical constraints of their natural habitats. Taken together, our findings bring some valuable data to better understand the genomic diversity and econiche adaptation within A. thiooxidans strains. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The analysis of codon usage bias has been widely used to characterize different communities of microorganisms. In this context, the aim of this work was to study the codon usage bias in a natural consortium of five acidophilic bacteria used for biomining. The codon usage bias of the consortium was contrasted with genes from an alternative collection of acidophilic reference strains and metagenome samples. Results indicate that acidophilic bacteria preferentially have low codon usage bias, consistent with both their capacity to live in a wide range of habitats and their slow growth rate, a characteristic probably acquired independently from their phylogenetic relationships. In addition, the analysis showed significant differences in the unique sets of genes from the autotrophic species of the consortium in relation to other acidophilic organisms, principally in genes which code for proteins involved in metal and oxidative stress resistance. The lower values of codon usage bias obtained in this unique set of genes suggest higher transcriptional adaptation to living in extreme conditions, which was probably acquired as a measure for resisting the elevated metal conditions present in the mine. © 2018 Hart et al.

	abstract = {Hot springs are natural habitats for thermophilic Archaea and Bacteria. In this paper, we present the metagenomic analysis of eight globally distributed terrestrial hot springs from China, Iceland, Italy, Russia, and the USA with a temperature range between 61 and 92 ∘C and pH between 1.8 and 7. A comparison of the biodiversity and community composition generally showed a decrease in biodiversity with increasing temperature and decreasing pH. Another important factor shaping microbial diversity of the studied sites was the abundance of organic substrates. Several species of the Crenarchaeal order Thermoprotei were detected, whereas no single bacterial species was found in all samples, suggesting a better adaptation of certain archaeal species to different thermophilic environments. Two hot springs show high abundance of Acidithiobacillus, supporting the idea of a true thermophilic Acidithiobacillus species that can thrive in hyperthermophilic environments. Depending on the sample, up to 58 % of sequencing reads could not be assigned to a known phylum, reinforcing the fact that a large number of microorganisms in nature, including those thriving in hot environments remain to be isolated and characterized. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a toxic metalloid known to cause multiple and severe cellular damages, including lipid peroxidation, protein misfolding, mutagenesis and double and single-stranded DNA breaks. Thus, exposure to this compound is lethal for most organisms but some species such as the photosynthetic protist Euglena mutabilis are able to cope with very high concentrations of this metalloid. Our comparative transcriptomic approaches performed on both an arsenic hypertolerant protist, i.e. E.mutabilis, and a more sensitive one, i.e. E.gracilis, revealed multiple mechanisms involved in arsenic tolerance. Indeed, E.mutabilis prevents efficiently the accumulation of arsenic in the cell through the expression of several transporters. More surprisingly, this protist induced the expression of active DNA reparation and protein turnover mechanisms, which allow E.mutabilis to maintain functional integrity of the cell under challenging conditions. Our observations suggest that this protist has acquired specific functions regarding arsenic and has developed an original metabolism to cope with acid mine drainages-related stresses. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Prokaryotic gene expression is environment-dependent and temperature plays an important role in shaping the gene expression profile. Revealing the regulation mechanisms of gene expression pertaining to temperature has attracted tremendous efforts in recent years particularly owning to the yielding of transcriptome and proteome data by high-throughput techniques. However, most of the previous works concentrated on the characterization of the gene expression profile of individual organism and little effort has been made to disclose the commonality among organisms, especially for the gene sequence features. In this report, we collected the transcriptome and proteome data measured under heat stress condition from recently published literature and studied the sequence determinants for the expression level of heat-responsive genes on multiple layers. Our results showed that there indeed exist commonness and consistent patterns of the sequence features among organisms for the differentially expressed genes under heat stress condition. Some features are attributed to the requirement of thermostability while some are dominated by gene function. The revealed sequence determinants of bacterial gene expression level under heat stress complement the knowledge about the regulation factors of prokaryotic gene expression responding to the change of environmental conditions. Furthermore, comparisons to thermophilic adaption have been performed to reveal the similarity and dissimilarity of the sequence determinants for the response to heat stress and for the adaption to high habitat temperature, which elucidates the complex landscape of gene expression related to the same physical factor of temperature. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Porphyra is a macrophytic red alga of the Bangiales that is important ecologically and economically. We describe the genomes of three bacteria in the phylum Planctomycetes (designated P1, P2 and P3) that were isolated from blades of Porphyra umbilicalis (P.um.1). These three Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belong to distinct genera; P2 belongs to the genus Rhodopirellula, while P1 and P3 represent undescribed genera within the Planctomycetes. Comparative analyses of the P1, P2 and P3 genomes show large expansions of distinct gene families, which can be widespread throughout the Planctomycetes (e.g., protein kinases, sensors/response regulators) and may relate to specific habitat (e.g., sulfatase gene expansions in marine Planctomycetes) or phylogenetic position. Notably, there are major differences among the Planctomycetes in the numbers and sub-functional diversity of enzymes (e.g., sulfatases, glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases) that allow these bacteria to access a range of sulfated polysaccharides in macroalgal cell walls. These differences suggest that the microbes have varied capacities for feeding on fixed carbon in the cell walls of P.um.1 and other macrophytic algae, although the activities among the various bacteria might be functionally complementary in situ. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses indicate augmentation of gene functions through expansions arising from gene duplications and horizontal gene transfers; examples include genes involved in cell wall degradation (e.g., κ-carrageenase, alginate lyase, fucosidase) and stress responses (e.g., efflux pump, amino acid transporter). Finally P1 and P2 contain various genes encoding selenoproteins, many of which are enzymes that ameliorate the impact of environmental stresses that occur in the intertidal habitat.

	abstract = {Background: The Xanthomonas citri pv. citri (X. citri) is a phytopathogenic bacterium that infects different species of citrus plants where it causes canker disease. The adaptation to different habitats is related to the ability of the cells to metabolize and to assimilate diverse compounds, including sulfur, an essential element for all organisms. In Escherichia coli, the necessary sulfur can be obtained by a set of proteins whose genes belong to the cys regulon. Although the cys regulon proteins and their importance have been described in many other bacteria, there are no data related to these proteins in X. citri or in the Xanthomonas genus. The study of the relevance of these systems in these phytopathogenic bacteria that have distinct mechanisms of infection is one essential step toward understanding their physiology. In this work, we used bioinformatics, molecular modeling and transcription analysis (RT-PCR) to identify and characterize the putative cys regulon genes in X. citri. Results: We showed that the ATP Binding Cassette Transporter (ABC transporter) SbpCysUWA for sulfate uptake is conserved in X. citri and translated in presence of sulfate. On the other hand, differently from what is predicted in databases, according molecular modeling and phylogenetic analysis, X. citri does not show a proper taurine transporter, but two different ABC systems related to the alkanesulfonate/sulfonate transport that were recently acquired during evolution. RT-PCR analysis evidenced that these genes and their putative transcriptional regulator CysB are rather transcripted in XAM1, a medium with defined concentration of sulfate, than LB. Conclusions: The presence of at least three distinct systems for sulfate and sulfonates assimilation in X. citri evidenced the importance of these compounds for the bacterium. The transcription of genes involved with alkanesulfonate/sulfur compounds in XAM1 along to CysB suggests that despite the differences in the transporters, the regulation of these systems might be similar to the described for E. coli. Altogether, these results will serve as a foundation for further studies aimed to understanding the relevance of sulfur in growth, virulence and pathogenesis of X. citri and related bacteria. © 2015 Pereira et al.},

	abstract = {To gain an in-depth insight into the diversity and the distribution of genes under the particular evolutionary pressure of an arsenic-rich acid mine drainage (AMD), the genes involved in bacterial arsenic detoxification (arsB, ACR3) and arsenite oxidation (aioA) were investigated in sediment from Carnoulès (France), in parallel to the diversity and global distribution of the metabolically active bacteria. The metabolically active bacteria were affiliated mainly to AMD specialists, i.e., organisms detected in or isolated from AMDs throughout the world. They included mainly Acidobacteria and the non-affiliated “Candidatus Fodinabacter communificans,” as well as Thiomonas and Acidithiobacillus spp., Actinobacteria, and unclassified Gammaproteobacteria. The distribution range of these organisms suggested that they show niche conservatism. Sixteen types of deduced protein sequences of arsenite transporters (5 ArsB and 11 Acr3p) were detected, whereas a single type of arsenite oxidase (AioA) was found. Our data suggested that at Carnoulès, the aioA gene was more recent than those encoding arsenite transporters and subjected to a different molecular evolution. In contrast to the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes associated with AMD environments worldwide, the functional genes aioA, ACR3, and to a lesser extent arsB, were either novel or specific to Carnoulès, raising the question as to whether these functional genes are specific to high concentrations of arsenic, AMD-specific, or site-specific. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Numbers of cultivatable heterotrophic acidophilic bacteria were over an order of magnitude greater than those of chemolithotrophic acidophiles in both AMD ponds examined. Isolates identified as strains of Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, Acidiphilium organovorum, and Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum were isolated from the Balya AMD pond, and others identified as strains of Leptospirillum ferriphilum, Acidicapsa ligni, and Acidiphilium rubrum from Çan AMD. Other isolates were too distantly related (from analysis of their 16S rRNA genes) to be identified at the species level. Archaeal diversity in the two ponds appeared to be far more limited. T-RFLP and qPCR confirmed the presence of Ferroplasma-like prokaryotes, but no archaea were isolated from the two sites. qPCR generated semiquantitative data for genera of some of the iron-oxidizing acidophiles isolated and/or detected, suggesting the order of abundance was Leptospirillum > Ferroplasma > Acidithiobacillus (Balya AMD) and Ferroplasma > Leptospirillum > Acidithiobacillus (Çan AMD). © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, most acidophiles in AMD environments are uncultured microorganisms and little is known about the diversity of nitrogen-fixing genes and structure of nif gene cluster in AMD microbial communities. In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing to isolate nif genes in the AMD microbial community from Dexing Copper Mine, China. Meanwhile, a metagenome microarray containing 7,776 large-insertion fosmids was constructed to screen novel nif gene clusters. Metagenomic analyses revealed that 742 sequences were identified as nif genes including structural subunit genes nifH, nifD, nifK and various additional genes. The AMD community is massively dominated by the genus Acidithiobacillus. However, the phylogenetic diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is much higher than previously thought in the AMD community. Furthermore, a 32.5-kb genomic sequence harboring nif, fix and associated genes was screened by metagenome microarray. Comparative genome analysis indicated that most nif genes in this cluster are most similar to those of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, but the organization of the nif gene cluster had significant differences from H. seropedicae. Sequence analysis and reverse transcription PCR also suggested that distinct transcription units of nif genes exist in this gene cluster. nifQ gene falls into the same transcription unit with fixABCX genes, which have not been reported in other diazotrophs before. All of these results indicated that more novel diazotrophs survive in the AMD community. © 2014 Dai et al.},

In this context the genome of the heterotroph Acidiphilium sp.

JA12-A1 and the co-occurring chemolithoautotrophic iron oxidizer. The genome sequence consists of 4.18 Mbp on 297 contigs and harbors 4015 protein-coding genes and 50 RNA genes. Additionally, the molecular and functional organization of the Acidiphilium sp.

The comparative genome analysis underlines the close relationship between these strains and the highly similar metabolic potential supports the idea that other Acidiphilium strains play a similar role in various acid mine drainage communities.

Different candidate molecular and nonmolecular criteria are often broadly consistent with one another, which underpins the pluralistic approach to taxonomy. However, the taxonomic picture is clouded when underlying criteria are not in agreement, or when reference datasets contain erroneously named organisms. How does the shifting taxonomic landscape impact our interpretation of microbial communities, especially in the face of inconsistencies and errors? How can taxonomy be applied in a consistent way when different users have different requirements of the classifications that emerge?

	abstract = {The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated proteins) is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that is represented in most archaea and many bacteria. Among the currently known prokaryotic defense systems, the CRISPR-Cas genomic loci show unprecedented complexity and diversity. Classification of CRISPR-Cas variants that would capture their evolutionary relationships to the maximum possible extent is essential for comparative genomic and functional characterization of this theoretically and practically important system of adaptive immunity. To this end, a multipronged approach has been developed that combines phylogenetic analysis of the conserved Cas proteins with comparison of gene repertoires and arrangements in CRISPR-Cas loci. This approach led to the current classification of CRISPR-Cas systems into three distinct types and ten subtypes for each of which signature genes have been identified. Comparative genomic analysis of the CRISPR-Cas systems in new archaeal and bacterial genomes performed over the 3 years elapsed since the development of this classification makes it clear that new types and subtypes of CRISPR-Cas need to be introduced. Moreover, this classification system captures only part of the complexity of CRISPR-Cas organization and evolution, due to the intrinsic modularity and evolutionary mobility of these immunity systems, resulting in numerous recombinant variants. Moreover, most of the cas genes evolve rapidly, complicating the family assignment for many Cas proteins and the use of family profiles for the recognition of CRISPR-Cas subtype signatures. Further progress in the comparative analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems requires integration of the most sensitive sequence comparison tools, protein structure comparison, and refined approaches for comparison of gene neighborhoods. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

	abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD), associated with active and abandoned mining sites, is a habitat for acidophilic microorganisms that gain energy from the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds and ferrous iron and that thrive at pH below 4. Members of the recently proposed genus "Ferrovum" are the first acidophilic iron oxidizers to be described within the Betaproteobacteria. Although they have been detected as typical community members in AMD habitats worldwide, knowledge of their phylogenetic and metabolic diversity is scarce. Genomics approaches appear to be most promising in addressing this lacuna since isolation and cultivation of "Ferrovum" has proven to be extremely difficult and has so far only been successful for the designated type strain "Ferrovum myxofaciens" P3G. In this study, the genomes of two novel strains of "Ferrovum" (PN-J185 and Z-31) derived from water samples of a mine water treatment plant were sequenced. These genomes were compared with those of "Ferrovum" sp. JA12 that also originated from the mine water treatment plant, and of the type strain (P3G). Phylogenomic scrutiny suggests that the four strains represent three "Ferrovum" species that cluster in two groups (1 and 2). Comprehensive analysis of their predicted metabolic pathways revealed that these groups harbor characteristic metabolic profiles, notably with respect to motility, chemotaxis, nitrogen metabolism, biofilm formation and their potential strategies to cope with the acidic environment. For example, while the "F. myxofaciens" strains (group 1) appear to be motile and diazotrophic, the non-motile group 2 strains have the predicted potential to use a greater variety of fixed nitrogen sources. Furthermore, analysis of their genome synteny provides first insights into their genome evolution, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer and genome reduction in the group 2 strains by loss of genes encoding complete metabolic pathways or physiological features contributed to the observed diversification. © 2016 Ullrich, González, Poehlein, Tischler, Daniel, Schlömann, Holmes and Mühling.},

Genomic islands integrate into chromosomal loci such as transfer RNA genes and protein coding genes, whilst retaining various cargo genes that potentially bestow novel functions on the host organism. A gene encoding a putative integrase was identified at a single site within the 5′ end of the dusA gene in the genomes of over 200 bacteria. This integrase was discovered to be a component of numerous genomic islands, which appear to share a target site within the dusA gene. dusA encodes the tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase A enzyme, which catalyses the post-transcriptional reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine in tRNA. Genomic islands encoding homologous dusA-associated integrases were found at a much lower frequency within the related dusB and dusC genes, and non-dus genes. Excision of these dusA-associated islands from the chromosome as circularized intermediates was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Analysis of the dusA-associated islands indicated that they were highly diverse, with the integrase gene representing the only universal common feature. © 2015 The Author(s) 2015.

While stable isotope probing of proteins (protein-SIP) has been successfully applied to study interactions and elemental carbon and nitrogen fluxes, the volume and complexity of mass spectrometric data in protein-SIP experiments pose new challenges for data analysis. Together with a flexible experimental setup, the novel bioinformatics tool MetaProSIP offers an automated high-throughput solution for a wide range of 13C or 15N protein-SIP experiments with special emphasis on the analysis of metaproteomic experiments where differential labeling of organisms can occur. The information calculated in MetaProSIP includes the determination of multiple relative isotopic abundances, the labeling ratio between old and new synthesized proteins, and the shape of the isotopic distribution. These parameters define the metabolic capacities and dynamics within the investigated microbial culture. MetaProSIP features a high degree of reproducibility, reliability, and quality control reporting. The ability to embed into the OpenMS framework allows for flexible construction of custom-tailored workflows.

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing is expanding our knowledge of microbial diversity in the environment. Still, understanding the metabolic potentials and ecological roles of rare and uncultured microbes in natural communities remains a major challenge. To this end, we applied a 'divide and conquer' strategy that partitioned a massive metagenomic data set (>100 Gbp) into subsets based on K-mer frequency in sequence assembly to a low-diversity acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial community and, by integrating with an additional metatranscriptomic assembly, successfully obtained 11 draft genomes most of which represent yet uncultured and/or rare taxa (relative abundance <1%). We report the first genome of a naturally occurring Ferrovum population (relative abundance >90%) and its metabolic potentials and gene expression profile, providing initial molecular insights into the ecological role of these lesser known, but potentially important, microorganisms in the AMD environment. Gene transcriptional analysis of the active taxa revealed major metabolic capabilities executed in situ, including carbon- and nitrogen-related metabolisms associated with syntrophic interactions, iron and sulfur oxidation, which are key in energy conservation and AMD generation, and the mechanisms of adaptation and response to the environmental stresses (heavy metals, low pH and oxidative stress). Remarkably, nitrogen fixation and sulfur oxidation were performed by the rare taxa, indicating their critical roles in the overall functioning and assembly of the AMD community. Our study demonstrates the potential of the 'divide and conquer' strategy in high-throughput sequencing data assembly for genome reconstruction and functional partitioning analysis of both dominant and rare species in natural microbial assemblages. © 2015 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

	abstract = {Neutrophilic microaerophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) are thought to play a significant role in cycling of carbon, iron and associated elements in both freshwater and marine iron-rich environments. However, the roles of the neutrophilic microaerophilic FeOB are still poorly understood due largely to the difficulty of cultivation and lack of functional gene markers. Here, we analyze the genomes of two freshwater neutrophilic microaerophilic stalk-forming FeOB, Ferriphaselus amnicola OYT1 and Ferriphaselus strain R-1. Phylogenetic analyses confirm that these are distinct species within Betaproteobacteria; we describe strain R-1 and propose the name F. globulitus. We compare the genomes to those of two freshwater Betaproteobacterial and three marine Zetaproteobacterial FeOB isolates in order to look for mechanisms common to all FeOB, or just stalk-forming FeOB. The OYT1 and R-1 genomes both contain homologs to cyc2, which encodes a protein that has been shown to oxidize Fe in the acidophilic FeOB, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. This c-type cytochrome common to all seven microaerophilic FeOB isolates, strengthening the case for its common utility in the Fe oxidation pathway. In contrast, the OYT1 and R-1 genomes lack mto genes found in other freshwater FeOB. OYT1 and R-1 both have genes that suggest they can oxidize sulfur species. Both have the genes necessary to fix carbon by the Calvin-Benson-Basshom pathway, while only OYT1 has the genes necessary to fix nitrogen. The stalk-forming FeOB share xag genes that may help form the polysaccharide structure of stalks. Both OYT1 and R-1 make a novel biomineralization structure, short rod-shaped Fe oxyhydroxides much smaller than their stalks; these oxides are constantly shed, and may be a vector for C, P, and metal transport to downstream environments. Our results show that while different FeOB are adapted to particular niches, freshwater and marine FeOB likely share common mechanisms for Fe oxidation electron transport and biomineralization pathways. © 2015 Kato, Ohkuma, Powell, Krepski, Oshima, Hattori, Shapiro, Woyke and Chan.},

In laboratory settings, aerobic bacteria are usually cultured in aerated flasks, where the cells are considered essentially homogenous. However, in many natural environments, bacteria and other microorganisms grow in mixed communities, often associated with surfaces. Biofilms are comprised of surface-associated microorganisms, their extracellular matrix material, and environmental chemicals that have adsorbed to the bacteria or their matrix material. While this definition of a biofilm is fairly simple, biofilms are complex and dynamic. Our understanding of the activities of individual biofilm cells and whole biofilm systems has developed rapidly, due in part to advances in molecular, analytical, and imaging tools and the miniaturization of tools designed to characterize biofilms at the enzyme level, cellular level, and systems level. © 2016 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Studies of the secretomes of microbes grown on insoluble substrates are important for the discovery of novel proteins involved in biomass conversion. However, data in literature and this study indicate that secretome samples tend to be contaminated with cytoplasmic proteins. We have examined the secretome of the Gram-negative soil bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus using a simple plate-based culturing technique that yields samples with high fractions (60–75%) of proteins that are predicted to be secreted. By combining this approach with label-free quantification using the MaxLFQ algorithm, we have mapped and quantified proteins secreted by C. japonicus during growth on α- and β-chitin. Hierarchical clustering of the detected protein quantities revealed groups of up-regulated proteins that include all five putative C. japonicus chitinases as well as a chitin-specific lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (CjLPMO10A). A small set of secreted proteins were co-regulated with known chitin-specific enzymes, including several with unknown catalytic functions. These proteins provide interesting targets for further studies aimed at unraveling the enzymatic machineries used by C. japonicus for recalcitrant polysaccharide degradation. Studies of chitin degradation indicated that C. japonicus indeed produces an efficient chitinolytic enzyme cocktail.

	abstract = {Background: Members of the genus "Ferrovum" are ubiquitously distributed in acid mine drainage (AMD) waters which are characterised by their high metal and sulfate loads. So far isolation and microbiological characterisation have only been successful for the designated type strain "Ferrovum myxofaciens" P3G. Thus, knowledge about physiological characteristics and the phylogeny of the genus "Ferrovum" is extremely scarce. Objective: In order to access the wider genetic pool of the genus "Ferrovum" we sequenced the genome of a "Ferrovum"-containing mixed culture and successfully assembled the almost complete genome sequence of the novel "Ferrovum" strain JA12. Phylogeny and lifestyle: The genome-based phylogenetic analysis indicates that strain JA12 and the type strain represent two distinct "Ferrovum" species. "Ferrovum" strain JA12 is characterised by an unusually small genome in comparison to the type strain and other iron oxidising bacteria. The prediction of nutrient assimilation pathways suggests that "Ferrovum" strain JA12 maintains a chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle utilising carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, ammonium and urea, sulfate, phosphate and ferrous iron as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous and energy sources, respectively. Unique Metabolic Features: The potential utilisation of urea by "Ferrovum" strain JA12 is moreover remarkable since it may furthermore represent a strategy among extreme acidophiles to cope with the acidic environment. Unlike other acidophilic chemolithoautotrophs "Ferrovum" strain JA12 exhibits a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle, a metabolic feature shared with the closer related neutrophilic iron oxidisers among the Betaproteobacteria including Sideroxydans lithotrophicus and Thiobacillus denitrificans. Furthermore, the absence of characteristic redox proteins involved in iron oxidation in the well-studied acidophiles Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (rusticyanin) and Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans (iron oxidase) indicates the existence of a modified pathway in "Ferrovum" strain JA12. Therefore, the results of the present study extend our understanding of the genus "Ferrovum" and provide a comprehensive framework for future comparative genome and metagenome studies. © 2016 Ullrich et al.},

	abstract = {The results of recent biofilm characterizations have helped reveal the complexities of these surface-associated communities of microorganisms. The activities of the cells and the structure of the extracellular matrix material demonstrate that biofilm bacteria engage in a variety of physiological behaviors that are distinct from planktonic cells (1-3). For example, bacteria in biofilms are adapted to growth on surfaces, and most produce adhesins and extracellular polymers that allow the cells to firmly adhere to the surfaces or to neighboring cells (4-6). The extracellular material of biofilms contains polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA that form a glue-like substance for adhesion to the surface and for the three-dimensional (3D) biofilm architecture (4). The matrix material, although produced by the individual cells, forms structures that provide benefits for the entire community, including protection of the cells from various environmental stresses (7-9). Biofilm cells form a community and engage in intercellular signaling activities (10-19). Diffusible signaling molecules and metabolites provide cues for expression of genes that may benefit the entire community, such as genes for production of extracellular enzymes that allow the biofilm bacteria to utilize complex nutrient sources (18,20-22). Biofilm cells are not static. Many microorganisms have adapted to surface-associated motility, such as twitching and swarming motility (23-28). Cellular activities, including matrix production, intercellular signaling, and surface-associated swarming motility suggest that biofilms engage in communal activities. As a result, biofilms have been compared to multicellular organs where cells differentiate with specialized functions (2,29). However, bacteria do not always cooperate with each other. Biofilms are also sites of intense competition. The bacteria within biofilms compete for nutrients and space by producing toxic chemicals to inhibit or kill neighboring cells or inject toxins directly into neighboring cells through type VI secretion (30-33). Therefore, biofilm cells exhibit both communal and competitive activities. © 2015 by ASM Press.},

	abstract = {Biocathode extracellular electron transfer (EET) may be exploited for biotechnology applications, including microbially mediated O2 reduction in microbial fuel cells and microbial electrosynthesis. However, biocathode mechanistic studies needed to improve or engineer functionality have been limited to a few select species that form sparse, homogeneous biofilms characterized by little or no growth. Attempts to cultivate isolates from biocathode environmental enrichments often fail due to a lack of some advantage provided by life in a consortium, highlighting the need to study and understand biocathode consortia in situ. Here, we present metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization of a previously described biocathode biofilm (+310 mV versus a standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]) enriched from seawater, reducing O2, and presumably fixing CO2 for biomass generation. Metagenomics identified 16 distinct cluster genomes, 15 of which could be assigned at the family or genus level and whose abundance was roughly divided between Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. A total of 644 proteins were identified from shotgun metaproteomics and have been deposited in the the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001045. Cluster genomes were used to assign the taxonomic identities of 599 proteins, with Marinobacter, Chromatiaceae, and Labrenzia the most represented. RubisCO and phosphoribulokinase, along with 9 other Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle proteins, were identified from Chromatiaceae. In addition, proteins similar to those predicted for iron oxidation pathways of known iron-oxidizing bacteria were observed for Chromatiaceae. These findings represent the first description of putative EET and CO2 fixation mechanisms for a selfregenerating, self-sustaining multispecies biocathode, providing potential targets for functional engineering, as well as new insights into biocathode EET pathways using proteomics. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {The appropriate choice of reference genes is essential for accurate normalization of gene expression data obtained by the method of reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). In 2009, a guideline called the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) highlighted the importance of the selection and validation of more than one suitable reference gene for obtaining reliable RT-qPCR results. Herein, we searched the recent literature in order to identify the bacterial reference genes that have been most commonly validated in gene expression studies by RT-qPCR (in the first 5 years following publication of the MIQE guidelines). Through a combination of different search parameters with the text mining tool MedlineRanker, we identified 145 unique bacterial genes that were recently tested as candidate reference genes. Of these, 45 genes were experimentally validated and, in most of the cases, their expression stabilities were verified using the software tools geNorm and NormFinder. It is noteworthy that only 10 of these reference genes had been validated in two or more of the studies evaluated. An enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology classifications demonstrated that genes belonging to the functional categories of DNA Replication (GO: 0006260) and Transcription (GO: 0006351) rendered a proportionally higher number of validated reference genes. Three genes in the former functional class were also among the top five most stable genes identified through an analysis of gene expression data obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center. These results may provide a guideline for the initial selection of candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR studies in several different bacterial species. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Human-induced ocean acidification impacts marine life. Marine bacteria are major drivers of biogeochemical nutrient cycles and energy fluxes; hence, understanding their performance under projected climate change scenarios is crucial for assessing ecosystem functioning. Whereas genetic and physiological responses of phytoplankton to ocean acidification are being disentangled, corresponding functional responses of bacterioplankton to pH reduction from elevated CO2 are essentially unknown. Here we show, from metatranscriptome analyses of a phytoplankton bloom mesocosm experiment, that marine bacteria responded to lowered pH by enhancing the expression of genes encoding proton pumps, such as respiration complexes, proteorhodopsin and membrane transporters. Moreover, taxonomic transcript analysis showed that distinct bacterial groups expressed different pH homeostasis genes in response to elevated CO2. These responses were substantial for numerous pH homeostasis genes under low-chlorophyll conditions (chlorophyll a <2.5 μg l-1); however, the changes in gene expression under high-chlorophyll conditions (chlorophyll a >20 μg l-1) were low. Given that proton expulsion through pH homeostasis mechanisms is energetically costly, these findings suggest that bacterioplankton adaptation to ocean acidification could have long-term effects on the economy of ocean ecosystems. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Autotrophic fixation of carbon dioxide into cellular carbon occurs via several pathways but quantitatively, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle is the most important. CbbR regulates the expression of the cbb genes involved in CO2 fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in a number of autotrophic bacteria. A gene potentially encoding CbbR (cbbRAF) has been predicted in the genome of the chemolithoautotrophic, extreme acidophile Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. However, this microorganism is recalcitrant to genetic manipulation impeding the experimental validation of bioinformatic predictions. Two novel functional assays were devised to advance our understanding of cbbRAF function using the mutated facultative autotroph Ralstonia eutropha H14 ΔcbbR as a surrogate host to test gene function: (i) cbbRAF was expressed in R. eutropha and was able to complement ΔcbbR; and (ii) CbbRAF was able to regulate the in vivo activity of four A. ferrooxidans cbb operon promoters in R. eutropha. These results open up the use of R. eutropha as a surrogate host to explore cbbRAF activity. © FEMS 2015.},

	abstract = {Snottites are extremely acidic (pH 0-2) biofilms that form on the walls and ceilings of hydrogen sulfide-rich caves. Recent work suggests that microbial communities including snottites and related cave wall biofilms accelerate cave formation by oxidizing sulfide to sulfuric acid. Therefore, we used full-cycle rRNA methods and metagenomics to explore the community composition and sulfur metabolism of snottites from the sulfidic Frasassi and Acquasanta cave systems, Italy. Acquasanta snottites were dominated by strains of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, with a smaller population of Ferroplasma sp. Frasassi snottites were also dominated by At. thiooxidans but with a more diverse community including relatives of 'G-plasma' (Thermoplasmatales), Acidimicrobium, and rare taxa. We identified diverse homologues of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) in the metagenomic datasets. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the numerically dominant At. thiooxidans populations have four different types of SQR, while Ferroplasma has two and Acidimicrobium and G-plasma each have one. No other genetic evidence for sulfur oxidation was detected for either Acidimicrobium or G-plasma, suggesting that they do not generate sulfuric acid. Our results confirm earlier findings that At. thiooxidans is the dominant primary producer and sulfide oxidizer in sulfidic cave snottites. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is one of the major tannery wastewater pollutants. Up today, chemical scrubbing is the most established technology for H2S removal in wastewater treatment plants. However, this procedure increases both the operating costs and the carbon footprint of the treatment. On the other hand, biological treatment is an emerging and sustainable technology for air pollution control. Our study focuses on the biological sulfur-oxidizing potential of autochthonous sludge of a plant treating tannery wastewater, located in Santa Croce (Tuscany, Italy). We propose a multidisciplinary approach to investigate two aspects: first, the composition of the microbial community both in the biological sludge and in the primary sludge and second, the sulfur-oxidizing potential of these native matrices. In order to do that, biological and primary sludge were used as inoculum in a reactor fed with sulfides. Then, traditional cultivation techniques were combined with several molecular approaches for analyzing the microbial community structure with a special focus on sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB). Our study demonstrated that the use of different techniques was fundamental in order to detect the largest number of sulfur-oxidizing bacterial components; in particular, the detection of less represented components was guaranteed only by the performed multidisciplinary approach. Our study demonstrated the optimal performances of the reactor in selecting a sulfur-oxidizing biomass from autochthonous matrices. In addition, the importance of the primary sludge as inoculum for sulfur-oxidizing reactors was proved. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is an inherited peripheral neuromuscular disorder characterized by length-dependent and progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves, leading to muscular weakness. Research has shown that mutated HSPB8 may be responsible for depression, neurodegenerative disorders, and improper functioning of peripheral nerves, resulting in neuromuscular disorders like CMT. In the current work, a hybrid approach of virtual screening and molecular docking studies was followed by homology modeling and pharmacophore identification. Detailed screening analyses were carried out by 2-D similarity search against prescribed antidepressant drugs with physicochemical properties. LigandScout was employed to ascertain novel molecules and pharmacophore properties. In this study, we report three novel compounds that showed maximum binding affinity with HSPB8. Docking analysis elucidated that Met37, Ser57, Ser58, Trp60, Thr63, Thr114, Lys115, Asp116, Gly117, Val152, Val154, Leu186, Asp189, Ser190, Gln191, and Glu192 are critical residues for ligand-receptor interactions. Our analyses suggested paroxetine as a potent compound for targeting HSPB8. Selected compounds have more effective energy scores than the selected drug analogs. Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis could be significant for further analysis of the binding pocket. The novel findings based on an in silico approach may be momentous for potent drug design against depression and CMT. © 2016 Sehgal et al.},

Many studies have investigated the function and molecular mechanism of microRNAs in the development and disease of various organisms via mRNA repression of protein-coding genes. Recent findings indicate microRNAs might trigger the generation of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs). The interaction among different types of small RNA molecules reveals an even more complicated and elaborate pattern of RNA regulation during gene expression than previously thought. We developed a method for mining ta-siRNA sequences and evaluated the performance of our novel method using data from Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, using small RNA and degradome data for the human brain, we identified 155 small RNAs that satisfied ta-siRNA characteristics. The DRAXIN and ATCAY genes, which are preferentially expressed in the human brain, were predicted to be the targets of 12 potential ta-siRNAs. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) is one of the major sources of NADPH when glucose is the sole carbon nutrient. However, unbalanced NADPH production causes growth impairment as observed in a strain lacking phosphoglucoisomerase (Δpgi). In this work, we studied the metabolic response of this bacterium to the replacement of its glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) by an NADH-producing variant. The homologous enzyme from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was studied by molecular dynamics and site-directed mutagenesis to obtain the NAD-preferring LmG6PDHR46E,Q47E. Through homologous recombination, the zwfloci (encoding G6PDH) in the chromosomes of WT and Δpgi E. coli strains were replaced by DNA encoding LmG6PDHR46E,Q47E. Contrary to some predictions performed with flux balance analysis, the replacements caused a substantial effect on the growth rates, increasing 59 % in the Δpgi strain, while falling 44 % in the WT. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of the zwf locus showed that the expression level of the mutant enzyme was similar to the native enzyme and the expression of genes encoding key enzymes of the central pathways also showed moderate changes among the studied strains. The phenotypic and qPCR data were integrated into in silico modelling, showing an operative G6PDH flux contributing to the NADH pool. Our results indicated that, in vivo, the generation of NADH by G6PDH is beneficial or disadvantageous for growth depending on the operation of the upper Embden–Meyerhof pathway. Interestingly, a genomic database search suggested that in bacteria lacking phosphofructokinase, the G6PDHs tend to have similar preferences for NAD and NADP. The importance of the generation of NADPH in a pathway such as the oxPPP is discussed. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The composition and metabolic activities of microbes in drinking water distribution systems can affect water quality and distribution system integrity. In order to understand regional variations in drinking water microbiology in the upper Ohio River watershed, the chemical and microbiological constituents of 17 municipal distribution systems were assessed. While sporadic variations were observed, the microbial diversity was generally dominated by fewer than 10 taxa, and was driven by the amount of disinfectant residual in the water. Overall, Mycobacterium spp. (Actinobacteria), MLE1-12 (phylum Cyanobacteria), Methylobacterium spp., and sphingomonads were the dominant taxa. Shifts in community composition from Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria to Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria were associated with higher residual chlorine. Alpha- and beta-diversity were higher in systems with higher chlorine loads, which may reflect changes in the ecological processes structuring the communities under different levels of oxidative stress. These results expand the assessment of microbial diversity in municipal distribution systems and demonstrate the value of considering ecological theory to understand the processes controlling microbial makeup. Such understanding may inform the management of municipal drinking water resources. Copyright: © 2016 Stanish et al.

	abstract = {Deep sequencing of prokaryotic 16S rDNA regularly reveals thousands of microbial species thriving in many common habitats. It is still unknown how this huge microbial diversity, including many potentially competing organisms, may persist at a single site. One of plausible hypotheses is that a large number of spatially separated microcommunities exist within each complex habitat. Smaller subset of the species may exist in each microcommunity and actually interact with each other. We sampled two groups of microbial stalactites growing at a single acidic mine drainage outlet as a model of multiplicated, low-complexity microhabitat. Samples from six other sites were added for comparison. Both tRFLP and 16S rDNA pyrosequencing showed that microbial communities containing 6 to 51 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTU) inhabited all stalactites. Interestingly, most OTUs including the highly abundant ones unpredictably alternated regardless of physical and environmental distance of the stalactites. As a result, the communities clustered independently on sample site and other variables when using both phylogenetic dissimilarity and OTU abundance metrics. Interestingly, artificial communities generated by pooling the biota of several adjacent stalactites together clustered by the locality more strongly than when the stalactites were analyzed separately. The most probable interpretation is that each stalactite contains likely random selection from the pool of plausible species. Such degree of stochasticity in assembly of extremophilic microbial communities is significantly greater than commonly proposed and requires caution when interpreting microbial diversity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Microbially-induced concrete corrosion in headspaces threatens wastewater infrastructure worldwide. Models for predicting corrosion rates in sewer pipe networks rely largely on information from culture-based investigations. In this study, the succession of microbes associated with corroding concrete was characterized over a one-year monitoring campaign using rRNA sequence-based phylogenetic methods. New concrete specimens were exposed in two highly corrosive manholes (high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide gas) on the Colorado Front Range for up to a year. Community succession on corroding surfaces was assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S bacterial rRNA amplicons and Sanger sequencing of 16S universal rRNA clones. Microbial communities associated with corrosion fronts presented distinct succession patterns which converged to markedly low α-diversity levels (< 10 taxa) in conjunction with decreasing pH. The microbial community succession pattern observed in this study agreed with culture-based models that implicate acidophilic sulfur-oxidizer Acidithiobacillus spp. in advanced communities, with two notable exceptions. Early communities exposed to alkaline surface pH presented relatively high α-diversity, including heterotrophic, nitrogen-fixing, and sulfur-oxidizing genera, and one community exposed to neutral surface pH presented a diverse transition community comprised of less than 20% sulfur-oxidizers. © 2015 Ling et al.},

	abstract = {All metals are toxic at high concentrations and consequently their intracellular concentrations must be regulated. Extremely acidophilic microorganisms have an optimum growth of pH < 3 and proliferate in natural and anthropogenic low pH environments. Some acidophiles are involved in the catalysis of sulfide mineral dissolution, resulting in high concentrations of metals in solution. Acidophiles are often described as highly metal resistant via mechanisms such as multiple and/or more efficient active resistance systems than are present in neutrophiles. However, this is not the case for all acidophiles and we contend that their growth in high metal concentrations is partially due to an intrinsic tolerance as a consequence of the environment in which they live. In this perspective, we highlight metal tolerance via complexation of free metals by sulfate ions and passive tolerance to metal influx via an internal positive cytoplasmic transmembrane potential. These tolerance mechanisms have been largely ignored in past studies of acidophile growth in the presence of metals and should be taken into account. © 2014 Dopson, Ossandon, Laóvgren and Holmes.},

	abstract = {The genus Sulfobacillus is a cohort of mildly thermophilic or thermotolerant acidophiles within the phylum Firmicutes and requires extremely acidic environments and hypersalinity for optimal growth. However, our understanding of them is still preliminary partly because few genome sequences are available. Here, the draft genome of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST was deciphered to obtain a comprehensive insight into the genetic content and to understand the cellular mechanisms necessary for its survival. Furthermore, the expressions of key genes related with iron and sulfur oxidation were verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The draft genome sequence of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST, which encodes 3225 predicted coding genes on a total length of 3,333,554 bp and a 48.35% G+C, revealed the high degree of heterogeneity with other Sulfobacillus species. The presence of numerous transposases, genomic islands and complete CRISPR/Cas defence systems testifies to its dynamic evolution consistent with the genome heterogeneity. As expected, S. thermosulfidooxidans encodes a suit of conserved enzymes required for the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds (ISCs). The model of sulfur oxidation in S. thermosulfidooxidans was proposed, which showed some different characteristics from the sulfur oxidation of Gram-negative A. ferrooxidans. Sulfur oxygenase reductase and heterodisulfide reductase were suggested to play important roles in the sulfur oxidation. Although the iron oxidation ability was observed, some key proteins cannot be identified in S. thermosulfidooxidans. Unexpectedly, a predicted sulfocyanin is proposed to transfer electrons in the iron oxidation. Furthermore, its carbon metabolism is rather flexible, can perform the transformation of pentose through the oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways and has the ability to take up small organic compounds. It encodes a multitude of heavy metal resistance systems to adapt the heavy metal-containing environments. © 2014 Guo et al.},

	abstract = {Following the trend of studies that investigate microbial ecosystems using different metagenomic techniques, we propose a new integrative systems ecology approach that aims to decipher functional roles within a consortium through the integration of genomic and metabolic knowledge at genome scale. For the sake of application, using public genomes of five bacterial strains involved in copper bioleaching: Acidiphilium cryptum, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans, we first reconstructed a global metabolic network. Next, using a parsimony assumption, we deciphered sets of genes, called Sets from Genome Segments (SGS), that (1) are close on their respective genomes, (2) take an active part in metabolic pathways and (3) whose associated metabolic reactions are also closely connected within metabolic networks. Overall, this SGS paradigm depicts genomic functional units that emphasize respective roles of bacterial strains to catalyze metabolic pathways and environmental processes. Our analysis suggested that only few functional metabolic genes are horizontally transferred within the consortium and that no single bacterial strain can accomplish by itself the whole copper bioleaching. The use of SGS pinpoints a functional compartmentalization among the investigated species and exhibits putative bacterial interactions necessary for promoting these pathways. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli is an important etiological agent of avian colibacillosis, which manifests as respiratory, hematogenous, meningitic, and enteric infections in poultry. It is also a potential zoonotic threat to human health. The diverse genomes of APEC strains largely hinder disease prevention and control measures. In the current study, pyrosequencing was used to analyze and characterize APEC strain ACN001 (= CCTCC 2015182T = DSMZ 29979T), which was isolated from the liver of a diseased chicken in China in 2010. Strain ACN001 belongs to extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli phylogenetic group B1, and was highly virulent in chicken and mouse models. Whole genome analysis showed that it consists of six different plasmids along with a circular chromosome of 4,936,576bp, comprising 4,794 protein-coding genes, 108 RNA genes, and 51 pseudogenes, with an average G + C content of 50.56%. As well as 237 coding sequences, we identified 39 insertion sequences, 12 predicated genomic islands, 8 prophage-related sequences, and 2 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats regions on the chromosome, suggesting the possible occurrence of horizontal gene transfer in this strain. In addition, most of the virulence and antibiotic resistance genes were located on the plasmids, which would assist in the distribution of pathogenicity and multidrug resistance elements among E. coli populations. Together, the information provided here on APEC isolate ACN001 will assist in future study of APEC strains, and aid in the development of control measures. © 2016 Wang et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Microbial diversity and community structures in acidic hot springs have been characterized by 16S rRNA gene-based diversity surveys. However, our understanding regarding the interactions among microbes, or between microbes and environmental factors, remains limited. Results: In the present study, a metagenomic approach, followed by bioinformatics analyses, were used to predict interactions within the microbial ecosystem in Shi-Huang-Ping (SHP), an acidic hot spring in northern Taiwan. Characterizing environmental parameters and potential metabolic pathways highlighted the importance of carbon assimilatory pathways. Four distinct carbon assimilatory pathways were identified in five dominant genera of bacteria. Of those dominant carbon fixers, Hydrogenobaculum bacteria outcompeted other carbon assimilators and dominated the SHP, presumably due to their ability to metabolize hydrogen and to withstand an anaerobic environment with fluctuating temperatures. Furthermore, most dominant microbes were capable of metabolizing inorganic sulfur-related compounds (abundant in SHP). However, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was the only species among key rare microbes with the capability to fix nitrogen, suggesting a key role in nitrogen cycling. In addition to potential metabolic interactions, based on the 16S rRNAs gene sequence of Nanoarchaeum-related and its potential host Ignicoccus-related archaea, as well as sequences of viruses and CRISPR arrays, we inferred that there were complex microbe-microbe interactions. Conclusions: Our study provided evidence that there were numerous microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions within the microbial community in an acidic hot spring. We proposed that Hydrogenobaculum bacteria were the dominant microbial genus, as they were able to metabolize hydrogen, assimilate carbon and live in an anaerobic environment with fluctuating temperatures. © 2015 Lin et al.},

	abstract = {Seafloor massive sulfides are a potential energy source for the support of chemosynthetic ecosystems in dark, deep-sea environments; however, little is known about microbial communities in these ecosystems, especially below the seafloor. In the present study, we performed culture-independent molecular analyses of sub-seafloor sulfide samples collected in the Southern Mariana Trough by drilling. The depth for the samples ranged from 0.52m to 2.67m below the seafloor. A combination of 16S rRNA and functional gene analyses suggested the presence of chemoautotrophs, sulfur-oxidizers, sulfate-reducers, iron-oxidizers and iron-reducers. In addition, mineralogical and thermodynamic analyses are consistent with chemosynthetic microbial communities sustained by sulfide minerals below the seafloor. Although distinct bacterial community compositions were found among the sub-seafloor sulfide samples and hydrothermally inactive sulfide chimneys on the seafloor collected from various areas, we also found common bacterial members at species level including the sulfur-oxidizers and sulfate-reducers, suggesting that the common members are widely distributed within massive sulfide deposits on and below the seafloor and play a key role in the ecosystem function. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) in the pathogenicity of campylobacteriosis, little is known about the genetic and phenotypic diversity of LOS in Campylobacter coli. In this study, we investigated the distribution of LOS locus classes among a large collection of unrelated C. coli isolates sampled from several different host species. Furthermore, we paired C. coli genomic information and LOS chemical composition for the first time to investigate possible associations between LOS locus class sequence diversity and biochemical heterogeneity. After identifying three new LOS locus classes, only 85% of the 144 isolates tested were assigned to a class, suggesting higher genetic diversity than previously thought. This genetic diversity is at the basis of a completely unexplored LOS structural heterogeneity. Mass spectrometry analysis of the LOSs of nine isolates, representing four different LOS classes, identified two features distinguishing C. coli LOS from that of Campylobacter jejuni. 2-Amino- 2-deoxy-D-glucose (GlcN)-GlcN disaccharides were present in the lipid A backbone, in contrast to the β-1'-6-linked 3-diamino- 2,3-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose (GlcN3N)-GlcN backbone observed in C. jejuni. Moreover, despite the fact that many of the genes putatively involved in 3-acylamino-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose (Quip3NAcyl) were apparently absent from the genomes of various isolates, this rare sugar was found in the outer core of all C. coli isolates. Therefore, regardless of the high genetic diversity of the LOS biosynthesis locus in C. coli, we identified species-specific phenotypic features of C. coli LOS that might explain differences between C. jejuni and C. coli in terms of population dynamics and host adaptation. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Extremely acidophilic microorganisms have an optimal pH of <3 and are found in all three domains of life. As metals are more soluble at acid pH, acidophiles are often challenged by very high metal concentrations. Acidophiles are metal-tolerant by both intrinsic, passive mechanisms as well as active systems. Passive mechanisms include an internal positive membrane potential that creates a chemiosmotic gradient against which metal cations must move, as well as the formation of metal sulfate complexes reducing the concentration of the free metal ion. Active systems include efflux proteins that pump metals out of the cytoplasm and conversion of the metal to a less toxic form. Acidophiles are exploited in a number of biotechnologies including biomining for sulfide mineral dissolution, biosulfidogenesis to produce sulfide that can selectively precipitate metals from process streams, treatment of acid mine drainage, and bioremediation of acidic metal-contaminated milieux. This review describes how acidophilic microorganisms tolerate extremely high metal concentrations in biotechnological processes and identifies areas of future work that hold promise for improving the efficiency of these applications. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, the biochemical mechanisms for Fe(II) oxidation by these neutrophilic FeOB are unknown, and genetic markers for this process are unavailable. In the ocean, microaerophilic microorganisms in the genus Mariprofundus of the class Zetaproteobacteria are the only organisms known to chemolithoautotrophically oxidize Fe and concurrently biomineralize it in the form of twisted stalks of iron oxyhydroxides. The aim of this study was to identify highly expressed proteins associated with the electron transport chain of microaerophilic, neutrophilic FeOB. To this end, Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1 was cultivated, and its proteins were extracted, assayed for redox activity, and analyzed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for identification of peptides. The results indicate that a cytochrome c4, cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase subunits, and an outer membrane cytochrome c were among the most highly expressed proteins and suggest an involvement in the process of aerobic, neutrophilic bacterial Fe oxidation. Proteins associated with alternative complex III, phosphate transport, carbon fixation, and biofilm formation were abundant, consistent with the lifestyle of Mariprofundus. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Complex life on our planet crucially depends on strong redox disequilibria afforded by the almost ubiquitous presence of highly oxidizing molecular oxygen. However, the history of O2-levels in the atmosphere is complex and prior to the Great Oxidation Event some 2.3 billion years ago, the amount of O2 in the biosphere is considered to have been extremely low as compared with present-day values. Therefore the evolutionary histories of life and of O2-levels are likely intricately intertwined. The obvious biological proxy for inferring the impact of changing O2-levels on life is the evolutionary history of the enzyme allowing organisms to tap into the redox power of molecular oxygen, i.e. the bioenergetic O2 reductases, alias the cytochrome and quinol oxidases. Consequently, molecular phylogenies reconstructed for this enzyme superfamily have been exploited over the last two decades in attempts to elucidate the interlocking between O2 levels in the environment and the evolution of respiratory bioenergetic processes. Although based on strictly identical datasets, these phylogenetic approaches have led to diametrically opposite scenarios with respect to the history of both the enzyme superfamily and molecular oxygen on the Earth. In an effort to overcome the deadlock of molecular phylogeny, we here review presently available structural, functional, palaeogeochemical and thermodynamic information pertinent to the evolution of the superfamily (which notably also encompasses the subfamily of nitric oxide reductases). The scenario which, in our eyes, most closely fits the ensemble of these non-phylogenetic data, sees the low O2-affinity SoxM- (or A-) type enzymes as the most recent evolutionary innovation and the high-affinity O2 reductases (SoxB or B and cbb3 or C) as arising independently from NO-reducing precursor enzymes. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Strains of Xylella fastidiosa constitute a complex group of bacteria that develop within the xylem of many plant hosts, causing diseases of significant economic importance, such as Pierce’s disease in North American grapevines and citrus variegated chlorosis in Brazil. X. fastidiosa has also been obtained from other host plants, in direct correlation with the development of diseases, as in the case of coffee leaf scorch (CLS) –a disease with potential to cause severe economic losses to the Brazilian coffee industry. This paper describes a thorough genomic characterization of coffeeinfecting X. fastidiosa strains, initially performed through a microarray-based approach, which demonstrated that CLS strains could be subdivided in two phylogenetically distinct subgroups. Whole-genomic sequencing of two of these bacteria (one from each subgroup) allowed identification of ORFs and horizontally transferred elements (HTEs) that were specific to CLSrelated X. fastidiosa strains. Such analyses confirmed the size and importance of HTEs as major mediators of chromosomal evolution amongst these bacteria, and allowed identification of differences in gene content, after comparisons were made with previously sequenced X. fastidiosa strains, isolated from alternative hosts. Although direct experimentation still needs to be performed to elucidate the biological consequences associated with such differences, it was interesting to verify that CLS-related bacteria display variations in genes that produce toxins, as well as surface-related factors (such as fimbrial adhesins and LPS) that have been shown to be involved with recognition of specific host factors in different pathogenic bacteria. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Heteronuclear metalloenzymes catalyze some of the most fundamentally interesting and practically useful reactions in nature. However, the presence of two or more metal ions in close proximity in these enzymes makes them more difficult to prepare and study than homonuclear metalloenzymes. To meet these challenges, heteronuclear metal centers have been designed into small and stable proteins with rigid scaffolds to understand how these heteronuclear centers are constructed and the mechanism of their function. This chapter describes methods for designing heterobinuclear metal centers in a protein scaffold by giving specific examples of a few heme–nonheme bimetallic centers engineered in myoglobin and cytochrome c peroxidase. We provide step-by-step procedures on how to choose the protein scaffold, design a heterobinuclear metal center in the protein scaffold computationally, incorporate metal ions into the protein, and characterize the resulting metalloproteins, both structurally and functionally. Finally, we discuss how an initial design can be further improved by rationally tuning its secondary coordination sphere, electron/proton transfer rates, and the substrate affinity. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Biotic and abiotic surfaces in marine waters are rapidly colonized by microorganisms. Surface colonization and subsequent biofilm formation and development provide numerous advantages to these organisms and support critical ecological and biogeochemical functions in the changing marine environment. Microbial surface association also contributes to deleterious effects such as biofouling, biocorrosion, and the persistence and transmission of harmful or pathogenic microorganisms and their genetic determinants. The processes and mechanisms of colonization as well as key players among the surface-associated microbiota have been studied for several decades. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific cell-surface, cell-cell, and interpopulation interactions shape the composition, structure, spatiotemporal dynamics, and functions of surface-associated microbial communities. Several key microbial processes and mechanisms, including (i) surface, population, and community sensing and signaling, (ii) intraspecies and interspecies communication and interaction, and (iii) the regulatory balance between cooperation and competition, have been identified as critical for the microbial surface association lifestyle. In this review, recent progress in the study of marine microbial surface colonization and biofilm development is synthesized and discussed. Major gaps in our knowledge remain. We pose questions for targeted investigation of surface-specific communitylevel microbial features, answers to which would advance our understanding of surface-associated microbial community ecology and the biogeochemical functions of these communities at levels from molecular mechanistic details through systems biological integration.

	abstract = {The purple bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1 expresses multiple small high-potential redox proteins during photoautotrophic growth, including two high-potential iron-sulfur proteins (HiPIPs) (PioC and Rpal_4085) and a cytochrome c2. We evaluated the role of these proteins in TIE-1 through genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses. Deleting the gene encoding cytochrome c2 resulted in a loss of photosynthetic ability by TIE-1, indicating that this protein cannot be replaced by either HiPIP in cyclic electron flow. PioC was previously implicated in photoferrotrophy, an unusual form of photosynthesis in which reducing power is provided through ferrous iron oxidation. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and flash-induced spectrometry, we show that PioC has a midpoint potential of 450 mV, contains all the typical features of a HiPIP, and can reduce the reaction centers of membrane suspensions in a light-dependent manner at a much lower rate than cytochrome c2. These data support the hypothesis that PioC linearly transfers electrons from iron, while cytochrome c2 is required for cyclic electron flow. Rpal_4085, despite having spectroscopic characteristics and a reduction potential similar to those of PioC, is unable to reduce the reaction center. Rpal_4085 is upregulated by the divalent metals Fe(II), Ni(II), and Co(II), suggesting that it might play a role in sensing or oxidizing metals in the periplasm. Taken together, our results suggest that these three small electron transfer proteins perform different functions in the cell. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

Lacking, however, are integrated community- and organism-wide comparative gene transcriptional analyses that could reveal the response and adaptation mechanisms of these extraordinary microorganisms to different environmental conditions. In this study, comparative metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were performed on microbial assemblages collected from four geochemically distinct acid mine drainage (AMD) sites. Taxonomic analysis uncovered unexpectedly high microbial biodiversity of these extremely acidophilic communities, and the abundant taxa of Acidithiobacillus, Leptospirillum and Acidiphilium exhibited high transcriptional activities. Community-wide comparative analyses clearly showed that the AMD microorganisms adapted to the different environmental conditions via regulating the expression of genes involved in multiple in situ functional activities, including low-pH adaptation, carbon, nitrogen and phosphate assimilation, energy generation, environmental stress resistance, and other functions. Organism-wide comparative analyses of the active taxa revealed environment-dependent gene transcriptional profiles, especially the distinct strategies used by Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum in nutrients assimilation and energy generation for survival under different conditions. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the gene transcriptional profiles of AMD microorganisms are closely related to the site physiochemical characteristics, providing clues into the microbial response and adaptation mechanisms in the oligotrophic, extremely acidic environments. © 2015 International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a representative species and has been extensively studied for its application to the bioleaching of precious metals. In our attempts to cultivate the type strain of A. ferrooxidans (ATCC 23270T), repeated transfers to fresh inorganic media resulted in the emergence of cultures with improved growth traits. Strains were isolated from the resultant culture by forming colonies on inorganic silica-gel plates. A representative isolate (strain NU-1) was unable to form colonies on agarose plates and was more sensitive to organics, such as glucose, than the type strain of A. ferrooxidans. Strain NU-1 exhibited superior growth traits in inorganic iron media to those of other iron-oxidizing acidithiobacilli, suggesting its potential for industrial applications. A draft genome of NU-1 uncovered unique features in catabolic enzymes, indicating that this strain is not a mutant of the A. ferrooxidans type strain. Our results indicate that the use of inorganic silica-gel plates facilitates the isolation of as-yet-unexamined iron-oxidizing acidithiobacilli from environmental samples and enrichment cultures. © 2016, Microbes and Environments.

The results indicate that sodium concentration, salinity, and electrical conductivity were significantly higher in contaminated samples, and that this correlates with different bacterial community structures. The most important differences were that (i) samples with detergent presented a lower species richness; (ii) Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in soils with detergent, while Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were the most abundant phyla in soils without detergent; (iii) Rhodomicrobium, Hydrogenophaga, and Thiobacillus were the most abundant genera in soils with detergent, while Acidobacteria dominated soils without detergent.

The results showed that 27~38 TCS proteins were respectively identified from the four Acidithiobacillus strains. These TCS proteins were clustered into 16 paired groups, four groups of orphan histidine protein kinases, and nine groups of orphan response regulator proteins, demonstrating significant correlationship with their evolutionary branches. Among TCS proteins, nine groups of paired TCSs and five groups of non-paired TCSs were shared by the four strains of Acidithiobacillus, while the other TCSs were absent at least in one strain. Common TCS proteins of the four strains played basic biological roles including nitrogen fixation and citrate/malate metabolism regulation. Specific TCS proteins got involved in chemotaxis regulation, heavy metal response, and copper resistance regulation, which might contribute to survival of bacterial strains under the extreme mine environment. ©, 2015, Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science.

	abstract = {Rocks and minerals surround the subsurface microbial habitat, yet mineralogy and rock chemistry are rarely considered when characterizing microbial diversity and the microbial ecosystem. Using laboratory biofilm reactors with both a pure culture of Thiothrix unzii and a mixed environmental sulfur-metabolizing community we found that the combination of buffering-capacity, cell wall electronegativity, nutrient content of the rock, and competitive exclusion of some populations control biomass density, α-diversity (local diversity), and β-diversity (global diversity) of the attached communities on mineral and rock surfaces. This suggests that different populations are better adapted to, and more competitive on, specific rock types. The primary influence on rock/mineral colonization by sulfur-oxidizing organisms is the acid-buffering capacity of the mineral substratum, with neutrophiles preferentially colonizing highly buffering carbonate rocks, while acidophiles select nonbuffering quartz. Beyond chemical controls, Thiothrix (often found in mid-ocean ridge environments) demonstrates an affinity for basalt, where it excludes other sulfur-oxidizers. A pure culture of T. unzii preferentially colonizes carbonates while all very closely related Thiothrix spp. are excluded from these same rock samples in a mixed culture. We report here experimental evidence that microorganisms colonize rock surfaces according to the rock's chemistry and the organism's metabolic requirements and tolerances. These results suggest that adaptations to specific rocks are retained even when the organism is displaced in time and space from an ancestral rock habitat. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is commonly used in bioleaching operations to recover copper from sulfide ores. It is commonly accepted that A. ferrooxidans attaches to mineral surfaces by means of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), however the role of type IV pili and tight adherence genes in this process is poorly understood. Genes related to the formation of type IV pili and tight adherence were identified in the genome of the bacterium, and in this work, we show that A. ferrooxidans actively expresses these genes, as demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis using cells incubated with chalcopyrite for 2h. Significant differences in gene expression were observed between planktonic and adhered cells, with the level of expression being much greater in planktonic cells. These results might indicate that planktonic cells can actively adhere to the substrate. A bioinformatics analysis of interaction networks of the tight adherence and type IV pilus assembly genes revealed a strong relationship between conjugation systems (tra operon) and regulatory systems (PilR, PilS). © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {The acid mine drainage (AMD) in Carnoulès (France) is characterized by the presence of toxic metals such as arsenic. Several bacterial strains belonging to the Thiomonas genus, which were isolated from this AMD, are able to withstand these conditions. Their genomes carry several genomic islands (GEIs), which are known to be potentially advantageous in some particular ecological niches. This study focused on the role of the "urea island" present in the Thiomonas CB2 strain, which carry the genes involved in urea degradation processes. First, genomic comparisons showed that the genome of Thiomonas sp. CB2, which is able to degrade urea, contains a urea genomic island which is incomplete in the genome of other strains showing no urease activity. The urease activity of Thiomonas sp. CB2 enabled this bacterium to maintain a neutral pH in cell cultures in vitro and prevented the occurrence of cell death during the growth of the bacterium in a chemically defined medium. In AMD water supplemented with urea, the degradation of urea promotes iron, aluminum and arsenic precipitation. Our data show that ureC was expressed in situ, which suggests that the ability to degrade urea may be expressed in some Thiomonas strains in AMD, and that this urease activity may contribute to their survival in contaminated environments. © 2015 Farasin, Andres, Casiot, Barbe, Faerber, Halter, Heintz, Koechler, Lièvremont, Lugan, Marchal, Plewniak, Seby, Bertin and Arsène-Ploetze.},

	abstract = {Recovery of metal value, especially from low-grade ores and overburden minerals using acidophilic bacteria through the process of bioleaching is an environmentally benign and commercially scalable biotechnology. In recent years, while the "OMICS" landscape has been witnessing extensive application of computational tools to understand and interpret global biological sequence data, a dedicated bioinformatic server for analysis of bacterial information in the context of its bioleaching ability is not available. We have developed an on-line Bacterial Bioleaching Protein Finder (BBProF) System, which rapidly identifies novel proteins involved in a bacterial bioleaching process and also performs phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes. BBProF uses the features of Asynchronous Java Script and XML (AJAX) to provide an efficient and fast user experience with minimal requirement of network bandwidth. In the input module the server accepts any bacterial or archaeal complete genome sequence in RAW format and provides a list of proteins involved in the microbial leaching process. BBProF web server is integrated with the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) web services such as BLAST for homology search and InterProScan for functional characterization of output protein sequences. Studying evolutionary relationship of bacterial strains of interest using Muscle and ClustalW2 phylogeny web services from EBI is another key feature of our server, where 16S rRNA gene sequences are considered as input through a JQUERY interface along with the sequences present in the BBProF database library. Complete genome sequences of 24 bioleaching microorganism characterized by genomic and physiological study in the laboratory and their respective 16S rRNA gene sequences were stored in the database of the BBProF library. To our knowledge BBProF is the first integrated bioinformatic web server that demonstrates its utility in identifying potential bioleaching bacteria. We hope that the server facilitate ongoing comparative genomic studies on of bioleaching microorganisms and also assist in identification and design of novel microbial consortia that are optimally efficient bioleaching agents. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Advances in sequencing have generated a large number of complete genomes. Traditionally, phylogenetic analysis relies on alignments of orthologs, but defining orthologs and separating them from paralogs is a complex task that may not always be suited to the large datasets of the future. An alternative to traditional, alignment-based approaches are whole-genome, alignment-free methods. These methods are scalable and require minimal manual intervention. We developed SlopeTree, a new alignment-free method that estimates evolutionary distances by measuring the decay of exact substring matches as a function of match length. SlopeTree corrects for horizontal gene transfer, for composition variation and low complexity sequences, and for branch-length nonlinearity caused by multiple mutations at the same site. We tested SlopeTree on 495 bacteria, 73 archaea, and 72 strains of Escherichia coli and Shigella. We compared our trees to the NCBI taxonomy, to trees based on concatenated alignments, and to trees produced by other alignment-free methods. The results were consistent with current knowledge about prokaryotic evolution. We assessed differences in tree topology over different methods and settings and found that the majority of bacteria and archaea have a core set of proteins that evolves by descent. In trees built from complete genomes rather than sets of core genes, we observed some grouping by phenotype rather than phylogeny, for instance with a cluster of sulfur-reducing thermophilic bacteria coming together irrespective of their phyla.

	abstract = {A legacy of coal mining in the Appalachians has provided a unique opportunity to study the ecological niches of iron-oxidizing microorganisms. Mine-impacted, anoxic groundwater with high dissolved-metal concentrations emerges at springs and seeps associated with iron oxide mounds and deposits. These deposits are colonized by iron-oxidizing microorganisms that in some cases efficiently remove most of the dissolved iron at low pH, making subsequent treatment of the polluted stream water less expensive. We used full-cycle rRNA methods to describe the composition of sediment communities at two geochemically similar acidic discharges, Upper and Lower Red Eyes in Somerset County, PA, USA. The dominant microorganisms at both discharges were acidophilic Gallionella-like organisms, "Ferrovum" spp., and Acidithiobacillus spp. Archaea and Leptospirillum spp. accounted for less than 2% of cells. The distribution of microorganisms at the two sites could be best explained by a combination of iron(II) concentration and pH. Populations of the Gallionella-like organisms were restricted to locations with pH > 3 and iron( II) concentration of > 4 mM, while Acidithiobacillus spp. were restricted to pH < 3 and iron(II) concentration of < 4 mM. Ferrovum spp. were present at low levels in most samples but dominated sediment communities at pH < 3 and iron(II) concentration of > 4 mM. Our findings offer a predictive framework that could prove useful for describing the distribution of microorganisms in acid mine drainage, based on readily accessible geochemical parameters. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

The genome sequence of the psychrotolerant Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans SS3 was compared to a metagenome from a low temperature acidic stream dominated by an A. ferrivorans-like strain. Stretches of genomic DNA characterized by few matches to the metagenome, termed 'metagenomic islands', encoded genes associated with metal efflux and pH homeostasis. The metagenomic islands were enriched in mobile elements such as phage proteins, transposases, integrases and in one case, predicted to be flanked by truncated tRNAs. Cus gene clusters predicted to be involved in copper efflux and further Cus-like RND systems were predicted to be located in metagenomic islands and therefore, constitute part of the flexible gene complement of the species. Phylogenetic analysis of Cus clusters showed both lineage specificity within the Acidithiobacillus genus as well as niche specificity associated with an acidic environment. The metagenomic islands also contained a predicted copper efflux P-type ATPase system and a polyphosphate kinase potentially involved in polyphosphate mediated copper resistance. This study identifies genetic variability of low temperature acidophiles that likely reflects metal resistance selective pressures in the copper rich environment. © 2014 Institut Pasteur.},

	abstract = {A central tenant in microbial biogeochemistry is that microbial metabolisms follow a predictable sequence of terminal electron acceptors based on the energetic yield for the reaction. It is thereby oftentimes assumed that microbial respiration of ferric iron outcompetes sulfate in all but high-sulfate systems, and thus sulfide has little influence on freshwater or terrestrial iron cycling. Observations of sulfate reduction in low-sulfate environments have been attributed to the presumed presence of highly crystalline iron oxides allowing sulfate reduction to be more energetically favored. Here we identified the iron-reducing processes under low-sulfate conditions within columns containing freshwater sediments amended with structurally diverse iron oxides and fermentation products that fuel anaerobic respiration. We show that despite low sulfate concentrations and regardless of iron oxide substrate (ferrihydrite, Al-ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite), sulfidization was a dominant pathway in iron reduction. This process was mediated by (re)cycling of sulfur upon reaction of sulfide and iron oxides to support continued sulfur-based respiration - a cryptic sulfur cycle involving generation and consumption of sulfur intermediates. Although canonical iron respiration was not observed in the sediments amended with the more crystalline iron oxides, iron respiration did become dominant in the presence of ferrihydrite once sulfate was consumed. Thus, despite more favorable energetics, ferrihydrite reduction did not precede sulfate reduction and instead an inverse redox zonation was observed. These findings indicate that sulfur (re)cycling is a dominant force in iron cycling even in low-sulfate systems and in a manner difficult to predict using the classical thermodynamic ladder. © 2015 International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

	abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Sulfobacillus are found worldwide as members of microbial communities that accelerate sulfide mineral dissolution in acid mine drainage environments (AMD), acid-rock drainage environments (ARD), as well as in industrial bioleaching operations. Despite their frequent identification in these environments, their role in biogeochemical cycling is poorly understood. Results: Here we report draft genomes of five species of the Sulfobacillus genus (AMDSBA1-5) reconstructed by cultivation-independent sequencing of biofilms sampled from the Richmond Mine (Iron Mountain, CA). Three of these species (AMDSBA2, AMDSBA3, and AMDSBA4) have no cultured representatives while AMDSBA1 is a strain of S. benefaciens, and AMDSBA5 a strain of S. thermosulfidooxidans. We analyzed the diversity of energy conservation and central carbon metabolisms for these genomes and previously published Sulfobacillus genomes. Pathways of sulfur oxidation vary considerably across the genus, including the number and type of subunits of putative heterodisulfide reductase complexes likely involved in sulfur oxidation. The number and type of nickel-iron hydrogenase proteins varied across the genus, as does the presence of different central carbon pathways. Only the AMDSBA3 genome encodes a dissimilatory nitrate reducatase and only the AMDSBA5 and S. thermosulfidooxidans genomes encode assimilatory nitrate reductases. Within the genus, AMDSBA4 is unusual in that its electron transport chain includes a cytochrome bc type complex, a unique cytochrome c oxidase, and two distinct succinate dehydrogenase complexes. Conclusions: Overall, the results significantly expand our understanding of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen metabolism within the Sulfobacillus genus. © Justice et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms that respire electrodes may be exploited for biotechnology applications if key pathways for extracellular electron transfer can be identified and manipulated through bioengineering. To determine whether expression of proposed Biocathode-MCL extracellular electron transfer proteins are changed by modulating electrode potential without disrupting the relative distribution of microbial constituents, metaproteomic and 16S rRNA gene expression analyses were performed after switching from an optimal to suboptimal potential based on an expected decrease in electrode respiration. Five hundred and seventy-nine unique proteins were identified across both potentials, the majority of which were assigned to three previously defined Biocathode-MCL metagenomic clusters: a Marinobacter sp., a member of the family Chromatiaceae, and a Labrenzia sp (abbreviated as MCL). Statistical analysis of spectral counts using the Fisher's exact test identified 16 proteins associated with the optimal potential, five of which are predicted electron transfer proteins. The majority of proteins associated with the suboptimal potential were involved in protein turnover/synthesis, motility, and membrane transport. Unipept and 16S rRNA gene expression analyses indicated that the taxonomic profile of the microbiome did not change after 52 h at the suboptimal potential. These findings show that protein expression is sensitive to the electrode potential without inducing shifts in community composition, a feature that may be exploited for engineering Biocathode-MCL.

	abstract = {Although Escherichia coli is the most widely studied bacterial model organism and often considered to be the model bacterium per se, its type strain was until now forgotten from microbial genomics. As a part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project, we here describe the features of E. coli DSM 30083T together with its genome sequence and annotation as well as novel aspects of its phenotype. The 5,038,133 bp containing genome sequence includes 4,762 protein-coding genes and 175 RNA genes as well as a single plasmid. Affiliation of a set of 250 genome-sequenced E. coli strains, Shigella and outgroup strains to the type strain of E. coli was investigated using digital DNA:DNA-hybridization (dDDH) similarities and differences in genomic G+C content. As in the majority of previous studies, results show Shigella spp. embedded within E. coli and in most cases forming a single subgroup of it. Phylogenomic trees also recover the proposed E. coli phylotypes as monophyla with minor exceptions and place DSM 30083T in phylotype B2 with E. coli S88 as its closest neighbor. The widely used lab strain K-12 is not only genomically but also physiologically strongly different from the type strain. The phylotypes do not express a uniform level of character divergence as measured using dDDH, however, thus an alternative arrangement is proposed and discussed in the context of bacterial subspecies. Analyses of the genome sequences of a large number of E. coli strains and of strains from > 100 other bacterial genera indicate a value of 79-80% dDDH as the most promising threshold for delineating subspecies, which in turn suggests the presence of five subspecies within E. coli. © 2014 Meier-Kolthoff et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Metagenomic sequencing of the biofilm and planktonic fractions identified the most abundant microorganism to besimilar to the psychrotolerant acidophile, Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans. In addition, metagenome contigs were most similar toother Acidithiobacillus species, an Acidobacteria-like species, and a Gallionellaceae-like species. Analyses of the metagenomesindicated functional characteristics previously characterized as related to growth at low temperature including cold-shockproteins, several pathways for the production of compatible solutes and an anti-freeze protein. In addition, genes werepredicted to encode functions related to pH homeostasis and metal resistance related to growth in the acidicmetal-containing mine water. Metagenome analyses identified microorganisms capable of nitrogen fixation and exhibitinga primarily autotrophic lifestyle driven by the oxidation of the ferrous iron and inorganic sulfur compounds contained in thesulfidic mine waters. The study identified a low diversity of abundant microorganisms adapted to a low-temperature acidicenvironment as well as identifying some of the strategies the microorganisms employ to grow in this extreme environment. © FEMS 2015.},

	abstract = {Background: Microbial communities adapt to environmental conditions for optimizing metabolic flux. Such adaption may include cooperative mechanisms eventually resulting in phenotypic observables as emergent properties that cannot be attributed to an individual species alone. Understanding the molecular basis of cross-species cooperation adds to utilization of microbial communities in industrial applications including metal bioleaching and bioremediation processes. With significant advancements in metagenomics the composition of microbial communities became amenable for integrative analysis on the level of entangled molecular processes involving more than one species, in turn offering a data matrix for analyzing the molecular basis of cooperative phenomena. Methods: We present an analysis framework aligned with a dynamical hierarchies concept for unraveling emergent properties in microbial communities, and exemplify this approach for a co-culture setting of At. ferrooxidans and At. thiooxidans. This minimum microbial community demonstrates a significant increase in bioleaching efficiency compared to the activity of individual species, involving mechanisms of the thiosulfate, the polysulfide and the iron oxidation pathway. Results: Populating gene-centric data structures holding rich functional annotation and interaction information allows deriving network models at the functional level coupling energy production and transport processes of both microbial species. Applying a network segmentation approach on the interaction network of ortholog genes covering energy production and transport proposes a set of specific molecular processes of relevance in bioleaching. The resulting molecular process model essentially involves functionalities such as iron oxidation, nitrogen metabolism and proton transport, complemented by sulfur oxidation and nitrogen metabolism, as well as a set of ion transporter functionalities. At. ferrooxidans-specific genes embedded in the molecular model representation hold gene functions supportive for ammonia utilization as well as for biofilm formation, resembling key elements for effective chalcopyrite bioleaching as emergent property in the co-culture situation. Conclusions: Analyzing the entangled molecular processes of a microbial community on the level of segmented, gene-centric interaction networks allows identification of core molecular processes and functionalities adding to our mechanistic understanding of emergent properties of microbial consortia. © 2015 Bosse et al.},

	abstract = {The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum apicoplast indirect aminoacylation pathway utilizes a non-discriminating glutamyl-tRNA synthetase to synthesize Glu-tRNAGln and a glutaminyl-tRNA amidotransferase to convert Glu-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln. Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum and other apicomplexans possess a unique heterodimeric glutamyltRNA amidotransferase consisting of GatA and GatB subunits (GatAB). We localized the P. falciparum GatA and GatB subunits to the apicoplast in blood stage parasites and demonstrated that recombinant GatAB converts Glu-tRNAGln to Gln-tRNAGln in vitro. We demonstrate that the apicoplast GatAB-catalyzed reaction is essential to the parasite blood stages because we could not delete the Plasmodium berghei gene encoding GatA in blood stage parasites in vivo. A phylogenetic analysis placed the split between Plasmodium GatB, archaeal GatE, and bacterial GatB prior to the phylogenetic divide between bacteria and archaea. Moreover, Plasmodium GatA also appears to have emerged prior to the bacterial-archaeal phylogenetic divide. Thus, although GatAB is found in Plasmodium, it emerged prior to the phylogenetic separation of archaea and bacteria. © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	abstract = {Two acid mine drainage (AMD) sites in the Appalachian bituminous coal basin were selected to enrich for Fe(II)-oxidizing microbes and measure rates of low-pH Fe(II) oxidation in chemostatic bioreactors. Microbial communities were enriched for 74 to 128 days in fed-batch mode, then switched to flowthrough mode (additional 52 to 138 d) to measure rates of Fe(II) oxidation as a function of pH (2.1 to 4.2) and influent Fe(II) concentration (80 to 2,400 mg/liter). Biofilm samples were collected throughout these operations, and the microbial community structure was analyzed to evaluate impacts of geochemistry and incubation time. Alpha diversity decreased as the pH decreased and as the Fe(II) concentration increased, coincident with conditions that attained the highest rates of Fe(II) oxidation. The distribution of the seven most abundant bacterial genera could be explained by a combination of pH and Fe(II) concentration. Acidithiobacillus, Ferrovum, Gallionella, Leptospirillum, Ferrimicrobium, Acidiphilium, and Acidocella were all found to be restricted within specific bounds of pH and Fe(II) concentration. Temporal distance, defined as the cumulative number of pore volumes from the start of flowthrough mode, appeared to be as important as geochemical conditions in controlling microbial community structure. Both alpha and beta diversities of microbial communities were significantly correlated to temporal distance in the flowthrough experiments. Even after long-term operation under nearly identical geochemical conditions, microbial communities enriched from the different sites remained distinct. While these microbial communities were enriched from sites that displayed markedly different field rates of Fe(II) oxidation, rates of Fe(II) oxidation measured in laboratory bioreactors were essentially the same. These results suggest that the performance of suspended- growth bioreactors for AMD treatment may not be strongly dependent on the inoculum used for reactor startup. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.},

Microorganisms were enriched from REE-containing ores and recyclable materials with the goal of identifying strains capable of extracting REE from solid materials. Over 100 heterotrophic microorganisms were isolated and screened for their ability to produce organic acids capable of leaching REE. The ten most promising isolates were most closely related to Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Talaromyces. Of the acids produced, gluconic acid appeared to be the most effective at leaching REE (yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, europium, and terbium) from retorted phosphor powders (RPP), fluidized cracking catalyst (FCC), and europium-doped yttrium oxide (YOEu). The Acinetobacter isolate, BH1, was the most capable strain and able to leach 33% of the total REE content from the FCC material. These results support the continuing evaluation of gluconic acid-producing microbes for large-scale REE recovery from recyclable materials. © 2016 TAPPI Press. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {We reconstructed the complete 2.4Mb-long genome of a previously uncultivated epsilonproteobacterium, Candidatus Sulfuricurvum sp. RIFRC-1, via assembly of short-read shotgun metagenomic data using a complexity reduction approach. Genome-based comparisons indicate the bacterium is a novel species within the Sulfuricurvum genus, which contains one cultivated representative, S.kujiense. Divergence between the species appears due in part to extensive genomic rearrangements, gene loss and chromosomal versus plasmid encoding of certain (respiratory) genes by RIFRC-1. Deoxyribonucleic acid for the genome was obtained from terrestrial aquifer sediment, in which RIFRC-1 comprised ∼47% of the bacterial community. Genomic evidence suggests RIFRC-1 is a chemolithoautotrophic diazotroph capable of deriving energy for growth by microaerobic or nitrate-/nitric oxide-dependent oxidation of S0, sulfide or sulfite or H2 oxidation. Carbon may be fixed via the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. Consistent with these physiological attributes, the local aquifer was microoxic with small concentrations of available nitrate, small but elevated concentrations of reduced sulfur and NH4+/NH3-limited. Additionally, various mechanisms for heavy metal and metalloid tolerance and virulence point to a lifestyle well-adapted for metal(loid)-rich environments and a shared evolutionary past with pathogenic Epsilonproteobacteria. Results expand upon recent findings highlighting the potential importance of sulfur and hydrogen metabolism in the terrestrial subsurface. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the Zambales ophiolite range, terrestrial serpentinizing fluid seeps host diverse microbial assemblages. The fluids fall within the profile of Ca2+-OH--type waters, indicative of active serpentinization, and are low in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (<0.5 ppm). Influx of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) affects the solubility of calcium carbonate as distance from the source increases, triggering the formation of meter-scale travertine terraces. Samples were collected at the source and along the outflow channel to determine subsurface microbial community response to surface exposure. DNA was extracted and submitted for high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Taxonomic assignment of the sequence data indicates that 8.1% of the total sequence reads at the source of the seep affiliate with the genus Methanobacterium. Other major classes detected at the source include anaerobic taxa such as Bacteroidetes (40.7% of total sequence reads) and Firmicutes (19.1% of total reads). Hydrogenophaga spp. increase in relative abundance as redox potential increases. At the carbonate terrace, 45% of sequence reads affiliate with Meiothermus spp. Taxonomic observations and geochemical data suggest that several putative metabolisms may be favorable, including hydrogen oxidation, H2-associated sulfur cycling, methanogenesis, methanotrophy, nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, denitrification, nitrate respiration, methylotrophy, carbon monoxide respiration, and ferrous iron oxidation, based on capabilities of nearest known neighbors. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy suggest that microbial activity produces chemical and physical traces in the precipitated carbonates forming downstream of the seep's source. These data provide context for future serpentinizing seep ecosystem studies, particularly with regards to tropical biomes. © 2015 Woycheese, Meyer-Dombard, Cardace, Argayosa and Arcilla.},

	abstract = {Bacterial community analyses of samples from a pilot plant for the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the lignite-mining district in Lusatia (East Germany) had previously demonstrated the dominance of two groups of acidophilic iron oxidizers: the novel candidate genus "Ferrovum" and a group comprising Gallionella-like strains. Since pure culture had proven difficult, previous studies have used genome analyses of co-cultures consisting of "Ferrovum" and a strain of the heterotrophic acidophile Acidiphilium in order to obtain insight into the life style of these novel bacteria. Here we report on attempts to undertake a similar study on Gallionella-like acidophiles from AMD. Isolates belonging to the family Gallionellaceae are still restricted to the microaerophilic and neutrophilic iron oxidizers Sideroxydans and Gallionella. Availability of genomic or metagenomic sequence data of acidophilic strains of these genera should, therefore, be relevant for defining adaptive strategies in pH homeostasis. This is particularly the case since complete genome sequences of the neutrophilic strains G. capsiferriformans ES-2 and S. lithotrophicus ES-1 permit the direct comparison of the metabolic capacity of neutrophilic and acidophilic members of the same genus and, thus, the detection of biochemical features that are specific to acidophilic strains to support life under acidic conditions. Isolation attempts undertaken in this study resulted in the microaerophilic enrichment culture ADE-12-1 which, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, consisted of at least three to four distinct Gallionellaceae strains that appear to be closely related to the neutrophilic iron oxidizer S. lithotrophicus ES-1. Key hypotheses inferred from the metabolic reconstruction of the metagenomic sequence data of these acidophilic Sideroxydans strains include the putative role of urea hydrolysis, formate oxidation and cyanophycin decarboxylation in pH homeostasis. © 2016 Mühling, Poehlein, Stuhr, Voitel, Daniel and Schlömann.},

	abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell signalling pathway that allows bacteria to synchronize their genetic expression. It is mediated by autoinducers (AI), including (1) acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs or AI-1), produced by Proteobacteria using AinS, LuxI and HdtS synthase families and (2) furanosyl-diester-borate (FDB or AI-2), produced by a large range of phylogenetically diverse bacteria and synthetized by the LuxS family. Few data have been collected about the presence and importance of QS in marine waters using culture independent methods. In this study, we examined the presence and the diversity of AI-1 and AI-2 synthases in the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS), a large metagenomic database, covering 68 stations across 3 oceans. We built 4 reference protein databases with maximal phylogenetic coverage containing all known AI synthase sequences to retrieve AI synthases sequences from the GOS metagenomes. We retrieved 29 environmental sequences affiliated to LuxI (synthesizing AI-1), 653 related to HdtS (AI-1), 31 related to LuxS (AI-2) and only one for AinS (AI-1). AI synthases sequences were found in the 3 oceans covered by the GOS cruise and spanned a large phylogenetic diversity. These data revealed a large number of new marine AI sequences, suggesting that QS based on AI-1 diffusion is a widespread mechanism in the marine environment. © Inter-Research 2015.},

Differences in pore size and amino acid composition contribute to the specificity. Structure-based multiple sequence alignments shed light on the structure-function relations for all eight subclasses. Entropy-variability analysis results are correlated to known structural and functional aspects, such as structural integrity, multimericity, specificity and biological niche adaptation. The high mutation rate in their surface-exposed loops is likely an important mechanism for host immune system evasion. Multiple sequence alignments for each subclass revealed conserved residue positions that are involved in substrate recognition and specificity. An analysis of monomeric protein channels revealed particular sequence patterns of amino acids that were observed in other classes at multimeric interfaces. This adds to the emerging evidence that all members of the family exist in a multimeric state. Our findings are important for understanding the role of members of this family in a wide range of bacterial processes, including bacterial food uptake, survival and adaptation mechanisms. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In order to describe the dynamic behavior of a complex biological system, it is useful to combine models integrating processes at different levels and with temporal dependencies. Such combinations are necessary for modeling acclimatization, a phenomenon where changes in environmental conditions can induce drastic changes in the behavior of a biological system. In this article we formalize the use of hybrid systems as a tool to model this kind of biological behavior. A modeling scheme called strong switches is proposed. It allows one to take into account both minor adjustments to the coefficients of a continuous model, and, more interestingly, large-scale changes to the structure of the model. We illustrate the proposed methodology with two applications: acclimatization in wine fermentation kinetics, and acclimatization of osteo-adipo differentiation system linking stimulus signals to bone mass. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

It allows collapsing the tree branches at different taxonomic ranks and expanding the collapsed branches as well, keeping the overall topology of the tree unchanged. It also enables the user to observe the consequence of trial lineage modifications by re-collapsing the tree. The system reports taxon statistics at all ranks automatically after each collapsing and re-collapsing. These features greatly facilitate the comparison of the 16S rRNA sequence phylogeny with prokaryotic taxonomy in a taxon by taxon manner. In view of the fact that the present prokaryotic systematics is largely based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the current viewer may help reveal discrepancies between phylogeny and taxonomy. As an application, we show that in the latest release of LVTree, based on 11,939 rRNA sequences, as few as 24 lineage modifications are enough to bring all but two phyla (Proteobacteria and Firmicutes) to monophyletic clusters. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The extremely acidic brine lakes of the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia are home to some of the most biologically challenging waters on Earth. In this study, we employed metagenomic shotgun sequencing to generate a microbial profile of the depositional environment associated with the sulfur-rich sediments of one such lake. Of the 1.5 M high-quality reads generated, 0.25 M were mapped to protein features, which in turn provide new insights into the metabolic function of this community. In particular, 45 diverse genes associated with sulfur metabolism were identified, the majority of which were linked to either the conversion of sulfate to adenylylsulfate and the subsequent production of sulfide from sulfite or the oxidation of sulfide, elemental sulfur, and thiosulfate via the sulfur oxidation (Sox) system. This is the first metagenomic study of an acidic, hypersaline depositional environment, and we present evidence for a surprisingly high level of microbial diversity. Our findings also illuminate the possibility that we may be meaningfully underestimating the effects of biology on the chemistry of these sulfur-rich sediments, thereby influencing our understanding of past geobiological conditions that may have been present on Earth as well as early Mars. © 2015 Johnson et al.},

	abstract = {Mine tailings are a serious threat to the environment and public health. Remediation of these residues can be carried out effectively by the activation of specific microbial processes. This article presents detailed information about temporal changes in bacterial community composition during the remediation of a section of porphyry copper tailings deposited on the Bahía de Ite shoreline (Peru). An experimental remediation cell was flooded and transformed into a wetland in order to prevent oxidation processes, immobilizing metals. Initially, the top oxidation zone of the tailings deposit displayed a low pH (3.1) and high concentrations of metals, sulfate, and chloride, in a sandy grain size geological matrix. This habitat was dominated by sulfur- and iron-oxidizing bacteria, such as Leptospirillum spp., Acidithiobacillus spp., and Sulfobacillus spp., in a microbial community which structure resembled acid mine drainage environments. After wetland implementation, the cell was water-saturated, the acidity was consumed and metals dropped to a fraction of their initial respective concentrations. Bacterial communities analyzed by massive sequencing showed time-dependent changes both in composition and cell numbers. The final remediation stage was characterized by the highest bacterial diversity and evenness. Aside from classical sulfate reducers from the phyla δ-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, community structure comprised taxa derived from very diverse habitats. The community was also characterized by an elevated proportion of rare phyla and unaffiliated sequences. Numerical ecology analysis confirmed that the temporal population evolution was driven by pH, redox, and K. Results of this study demonstrated the usefulness of a detailed follow-up of the remediation process, not only for the elucidation of the communities gradually switching from autotrophic, oxidizing to heterotrophic and reducing living conditions, but also for the long term management of the remediation wetlands. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

This family of enzymes can be broadly divided into two functional classes: metalloxidases and laccases. Several prokaryotic metalloxidases have been described in the last decade showing a robust activity towards metals, such as Cu(I), Fe(II) or Mn(II) and have been implicated in the metal metabolism of the corresponding microorganisms. Many laccases, with a superior efficiency for oxidation of organic compounds when compared with metals, have also been identified and characterized from prokaryotes, playing roles that more closely conform to those of intermediary metabolism. This review aims to present an update of current knowledge on prokaryotic multicopper oxidases, with a special emphasis on laccases, anticipating their enormous potential for industrial and environmental applications. © Springer Basel 2015.},

Around 900,000 m3 of metal-rich, extremely acidic water are pumped out of the mine each year. The near constant air temperature of ~24°C together with exposure of sulfidic rock surfaces to air and water, have created an environment that is highly suitable for colonization by acidophilic mineral-oxidizing microorganisms. Using a combined cultivation-dependent and molecular approach, indigenous bacteria in waters at two depths within the mine, and of an acid streamer sample were identified and isolated. Iron-oxidizing chemolithotrophs (Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum spp., and "Ferrovum myxofaciens" were the most abundant bacteria in mine water samples, whereas the acid streamer community contained a greater proportion of heterotrophic acidophiles (Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum and a gammaproteobacterium related to Metallibacterium scheffleri). The most abundant isolates obtained from both water and streamer samples were all strains of Acidithiobacillus Group IV, a proposed separate species of iron-oxidizing acidithiobacilli that has not yet been classified as such.

	abstract = {Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) obtain energy from cytoplasmic reduction of sulfate to sulfide involving APS-reductase (AprAB) and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB). These enzymes are predicted to obtain electrons from membrane redox complexes, i.e. the quinone-interacting membrane-bound oxidoreductase (QmoABC) and DsrMKJOP complexes. In addition to these conserved complexes, the genomes of SRB encode a large number of other (predicted) membrane redox complexes, the function and actual formation of which is unknown. This study reports the establishment of 1D Blue Native-PAGE complexome profiling and 2D BN-/SDS-PAGE for analysis of the membrane protein complexome of the marine sulfate reducer Desulfobacula toluolica Tol2. Analysis of normalized score profiles of >800 proteins in combination with hierarchical clustering and identification of 2D BN-/SDS-PAGE separated spots demonstrated separation of membrane complexes in their native form, e.g. ATP synthase. In addition to the QmoABC and DsrMKJOP complexes, other complexes were detected that constitute the basic membrane complexome of D. toluolica Tol2, e.g. transport proteins (e.g. sodium/sulfate symporters) or redox complexes involved in Na+-based bioenergetics (RnfABCDEG). Notably, size estimation indicates dimer and quadruple formation of the DsrMKJOP complex in vivo. Furthermore, cluster analysis suggests interaction of this complex with a rhodanese-like protein (Tol2_C05230) possibly representing a periplasmic electron transfer partner for DsrMKJOP. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Although reduced inorganic sulfur compound (RISC) oxidation in many chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers has been investigated in recent years, there is little information about RISC oxidation in heterotrophic acidophiles. In this study, Acidicaldus sp. strain DX-1, a heterotrophic sulfur-oxidizing acidophile, was isolated. Its genome was sequenced and then used for comparative genomics. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR was performed to identify the expression of genes involved in the RISC oxidation. Gene encoding thiosulfate: quinone oxidoreductase was present in Acidicaldus sp. strain DX-1, while no candidate genes with significant similarity to tetrathionate hydrolase were found. Additionally, there were genes encoding heterodisulfide reductase complex, which was proposed to play a crucial role in oxidizing cytoplasmic sulfur. Like many heterotrophic sulfur oxidizers, Acidicaldus sp. strain DX-1 had no genes encoding enzymes essential for the direct oxidation of sulfite. An indirect oxidation of sulfite via adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate was proposed in Acidicaldus strain DX-1.

	abstract = {Licanantase (Lic) is the major component of the secretome of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans when grown in elemental sulphur. When used as an additive, Lic improves copper recovery frombioleaching processes. However, this recovery enhancement is not fully understood. In this context, our aim is to predict the 3D structure of Lic, to shed light on its structure-function relationships. Bioinformatics analyses on the amino acid sequence of Lic showed a great similarity with Lpp, an Escherichia coli Lipoprotein that can formstable trimers in solution. Lic and Lpp share the secretion motif, intracellular processing and alpha helix structure, as well as the distribution of hydrophobic residues in heptads forming a hydrophobic core, typical of coiled-coil structures. Cross-linking experiments showed the presence of Lic trimers, supporting our predictions. Taking the in vitro and in silico evidence as a whole, we propose that the most probable structure for Lic is a trimeric coiled-coil. According to this prediction, a suitable model for Lic was produced using the de novo algorithm "Rosetta Fold-and-Dock". To assess the structural stability of our model, Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Replica Exchange MD simulations were performed using the structure of Lpp and a 14-alanine Lpp mutant as controls, at both acidic and neutral pH. Our results suggest that Lic was the most stable structure among the studied proteins in both pH conditions. This increased stability can be explained by a higher number of both intermonomer hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds, key elements for the stability of Lic's secondary and tertiary structure. © 2014 Abarca et al.},

Long believed too extreme for life, recent advances in sample collection and DNA extraction methods have found that fumarole deposits and subsurface waters harbor a considerable diversity of viable microbes. In this study, we applied culture-independent molecular methods to explore fumarole deposit microbial assemblages in 15 different fumaroles in four geographic locations on the Big Island of Hawai'i. Just over half of the vents yielded sufficient high-quality DNA for the construction of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence clone libraries. The bacterial clone libraries contained sequences belonging to 11 recognized bacterial divisions and seven other division-level phylogenetic groups. Archaeal sequences were less numerous, but similarly diverse. The taxonomic composition among fumarole deposits was highly heterogeneous. Phylogenetic analysis found cloned fumarole sequences were related to microbes identified from a broad array of globally distributed ecotypes, including hot springs, terrestrial soils, and industrial waste sites. Our results suggest that fumarole deposits function as an "extremophile collector" and may be a hot spot of novel extremophile biodiversity. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Rubisco small subunits (RBCS) are encoded by a nuclear rbcS multigene family in higher plants and green algae. However, owing to the lack of rbcS sequences in lycophytes, the characteristics of rbcS genes in lycophytes is unclear. Recently, the complete genome sequence of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii provided the first insight into the rbcS gene family in lycophytes. To understand further the characteristics of rbcS genes in other Selaginella, the full length of rbcS genes (rbcS1 and rbcS2) from two other Selaginella species were isolated. Both rbcS1 and rbcS2 genes shared more than 97% identity among three Selaginella species. RBCS proteins from Selaginella contained the Pfam RBCS domain F00101, which was a major domain of other plant RBCS proteins. To explore the evolution of the rbcS gene family across Selaginella and other plants, we identified and performed comparative analysis of the rbcS gene family among 16 model plants based on a genome-wide analysis. The results showed that (i) two rbcS genes were obtained in Selaginella, which is the second fewest number of rbcS genes among the 16 representative plants; (ii) an expansion of rbcS genes occurred in the moss Physcomitrella patens; (iii) only RBCS proteins from angiosperms contained the Pfam PF12338 domains, and (iv) a pattern of concerted evolution existed in the rbcS gene family. Our study provides new insights into the evolution of the rbcS gene family in Selaginella and other plants.},

Among the members of this taxon, X. arboricola pv. pruni, the causal agent of bacterial spot disease of stone fruits and almond, is distributed worldwide although it is considered a quarantine pathogen in the European Union. Herein, we report the draft genome sequence, the classification, the annotation and the sequence analyses of a virulent strain, IVIA 2626.1, and an avirulent strain, CITA 44, of X. arboricola associated with Prunus spp. The draft genome sequence of IVIA 2626.1 consists of 5,027,671 bp, 4,720 protein coding genes and 50 RNA encoding genes. The draft genome sequence of strain CITA 44 consists of 4,760,482 bp, 4,250 protein coding genes and 56 RNA coding genes. Initial comparative analyses reveals differences in the presence of structural and regulatory components of the type IV pilus, the type III secretion system, the type III effectors as well as variations in the number of the type IV secretion systems. The genome sequence data for these strains will facilitate the development of molecular diagnostics protocols that differentiate virulent and avirulent strains.

	abstract = {Electron transport phosphorylation is the central mechanism for most prokaryotic species to harvest energy released in the respiration of their substrates as ATP. Microorganisms have evolved incredible variations on this principle, most of these we perhaps do not know, considering that only a fraction of the microbial richness is known. Besides these variations, microbial species may show substantial versatility in using respiratory systems. In connection herewith, regulatory mechanisms control the expression of these respiratory enzyme systems and their assembly at the translational and posttranslational levels, to optimally accommodate changes in the supply of their energy substrates. Here, we present an overview of methods and techniques from the field of proteomics to explore bacterial electron transfer chains and their regulation at levels ranging from the whole organism down to the Ångstrom scales of protein structures. From the survey of the literature on this subject, it is concluded that proteomics, indeed, has substantially contributed to our comprehending of bacterial respiratory mechanisms, often in elegant combinations with genetic and biochemical approaches. However, we also note that advanced proteomics offers a wealth of opportunities, which have not been exploited at all, or at best underexploited in hypothesis-driving and hypothesis-driven research on bacterial bioenergetics. Examples obtained from the related area of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation research, where the application of advanced proteomics is more common, may illustrate these opportunities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

However, life has evolved various strategies for coping with this toxic element. In particular, prokaryotic organisms have developed processes enabling them to resist and metabolize this chemical. Studies based on genome sequencing and transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiling have greatly improved our knowledge of prokaryotes' metabolic potential and functioning in contaminated environments. The increasing number of genomes available and the development of descriptive and comparative approaches have made it possible not only to identify several genetic determinants of the arsenic metabolism, but also to elucidate their phylogenetic distribution and their modes of regulation. In addition, studies using functional genomic tools have established the pleiotropic character of prokaryotes' responses to arsenic, which can be either common to several species or species-specific. These approaches also provide promising means of deciphering the functioning of microbial communities including uncultured organisms, the genetic transfers involved and the possible occurrence of metabolic interactions as well as the evolution of arsenic resistance and metabolism. © FEMS 2016.},

Characterized genes from the literature and a meta-analysis of 18 heavy metal gene microarray studies were used for comparison. Results: Unlike most bacteria, Frankia utilize all of the essential trace elements (Ni, Co, Cu, Se, Mo, B, Zn, Fe, and Mn) and have a comparatively high percentage of metalloproteins, particularly in the more metal resistant strains. Cation diffusion facilitators, being one of the few known metal resistance mechanisms found in the Frankia genomes, were strong candidates for general divalent metal resistance in all of the Frankia strains. Gene duplication and amino acid substitutions that enhanced the metal affinity of CopA and CopCD proteins may be responsible for the copper resistance found in some Frankia strains. CopA and a new potential metal transporter, DUF347, may be involved in the particularly high lead tolerance in Frankia. Selenite resistance involved an alternate sulfur importer (CysPUWA) that prevents sulfur starvation, and reductases to produce elemental selenium. The pattern of arsenate, but not arsenite, resistance was achieved by Frankia using the novel arsenite exporter (AqpS) previously identified in the nitrogen-fixing plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti. Based on the presence of multiple tellurite resistance factors, a new metal resistance (tellurite) was identified and confirmed in Frankia. Conclusions: Each strain had a unique combination of metal import, binding, modification, and export genes that explain differences in patterns of metal resistance between strains. Frankia has achieved similar levels of metal and metalloid resistance as bacteria from highly metal-contaminated sites. From a bioremediation standpoint, it is important to understand mechanisms that allow the endosymbiont to survive and infect actinorhizal plants in metal contaminated soils. © 2014 Furnholm and Tisa; licensee BioMed Central.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans is a sulfur oxidizing acidophilic bacterium found in many sulfur-rich environments. It is particularly interesting due to its role in bioleaching of sulphide minerals. In this work, we report the genome sequence of At. thiooxidans Licanantay, the first strain from a copper mine to be sequenced and currently used in bioleaching industrial processes. Through comparative genomic analysis with two other At. thiooxidans non-metal mining strains (ATCC 19377 and A01) we determined that these strains share a large core genome of 2109 coding sequences and a high average nucleotide identity over 98%. Nevertheless, the presence of 841 strain-specific genes (absent in other At. thiooxidans strains) suggests a particular adaptation of Licanantay to its specific biomining environment. Among this group, we highlight genes encoding for proteins involved in heavy metal tolerance, mineral cell attachment and cysteine biosynthesis. Several of these genes were located near genetic motility genes (e.g. transposases and integrases) in genomic regions of over 10kbp absent in the other strains, suggesting the presence of genomic islands in the Licanantay genome probably produced by horizontal gene transfer in mining environments. © 2014 Institut Pasteur.},

	abstract = {Using phylogenomic and gene compositional analyses, five highly conserved gene families have been detected in the core genome of the phylogenetically coherent genus Acidithiobacillus of the class Acidithiobacillia. These core gene families are absent in the closest extant genus Thermithiobacillus tepidarius that subtends the Acidithiobacillus genus and roots the deepest in this class. The predicted proteins encoded by these core gene families are not detected by a BLAST search in the NCBI non-redundant database of more than 90 million proteins using a relaxed cut-offof 1.0e-5. None of the five families has a clear functional prediction. However, bioinformatic scrutiny, using pI prediction, motif/domain searches, cellular location predictions, genomic context analyses, and chromosome topology studies together with previously published transcriptomic and proteomic data, suggests that some may have functions associated with membrane remodeling during cell division perhaps in response to pH stress. Despite the high level of amino acid sequence conservation within each family, there is sufficient nucleotide variation of the respective genes to permit the use of the DNA sequences to distinguish different species of Acidithiobacillus, making them useful additions to the armamentarium of tools for phylogenetic analysis. Since the protein families are unique to the Acidithiobacillus genus, they can also be leveraged as probes to detect the genus in environmental metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, including industrial biomining operations, and acid mine drainage (AMD). © 2016 González, Lazcano, Valdés and Holmes.},

Attachment of bacterial cells to the mineral surface is an important process for pyrite oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The selective advantage of bacterial adhesion is considered to favor the surface localization of bacterial populations as nutritionally favorable. Environmental factors determine cell accumulation or dissociation of attachment. In our study, the amount of sessile cells increased rapidly during the initial stage of attachment on pyrite. Planktonic cells showed high activity leading to the accumulation of large colonies on the pyrite surface. We found three proteins to be up-regulated significantly. Additionally, by matching the sequences of the three proteins to the Pfam database, we found that they are related to adhesion, pili biosynthesis and movement. When we replaced pyrite with glass to provide an inert surface that abolished electrostatic forces, we found that cell attachment was maintained under nutrient-rich conditions but drastically reduced under conditions of limited nutrients or the presence of the inhibitor homoserinelactone. Our results are consistent with the idea that starvation may lead to inhibition of attachment by an unknown mechanism that allows bacteria to search for nutrient-rich habitats. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: Genome sequencing has revolutionized our view of the relationships among genomes, particularly in revealing the confounding effects of lateral genetic transfer (LGT). Phylogenomic techniques have been used to construct purported trees of microbial life. Although such trees are easily interpreted and allow the use of a subset of genomes as "proxies" for the full set, LGT and other phenomena impact the positioning of different groups in genome trees, confounding and potentially invalidating attempts to construct a phylogeny-based taxonomy of microorganisms. Network and graph approaches can reveal complex sets of relationships, but applying these techniques to large data sets is a significant challenge. Notwithstanding the question of what exactly it might represent, generating and interpreting a Tree or Network of All Genomes will only be feasible if current algorithms can be improved upon.Results: Complex relationships among even the most-similar genomes demonstrate that proxy-based approaches to simplifying large sets of genomes are not alone sufficient to solve the analysis problem. A phylogenomic analysis of 1173 sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes generated phylogenetic trees for 159,905 distinct homologous gene sets. The relationships inferred from this set can be heavily dependent on the inclusion of other taxa: for example, phyla such as Spirochaetes, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are recovered as cohesive groups or split depending on the presence of other specific lineages. Furthermore, named groups such as Acidithiobacillus, Coprothermobacter and Brachyspira show a multitude of affiliations that are more consistent with their ecology than with small subunit ribosomal DNA-based taxonomy. Network and graph representations can illustrate the multitude of conflicting affinities, but all methods impose constraints on the input data and create challenges of construction and interpretation.Conclusions: These complex relationships highlight the need for an inclusive approach to genomic data, and current methods with minor alterations will likely scale to allow the analysis of data sets with 10,000 or more genomes. The main challenges lie in the visualization and interpretation of genomic relationships, and the redefinition of microbial taxonomy when subsets of genomic data are so evidently in conflict with one another, and with the "canonical" molecular taxonomy.Reviewers: The manuscript was reviewed by William Martin, W.

	abstract = {Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans gains energy from the oxidation of ferrous iron and various reduced inorganic sulfur compounds at very acidic pH. Although an initial model for the electron pathways involved in iron oxidation has been developed, much less is known about the sulfur oxidation in this microorganism. In addition, what has been reported for both iron and sulfur oxidation has been derived from different A. ferrooxidans strains, some of which have not been phylogenetically characterized and some have been shown to be mixed cultures. It is necessary to provide models of iron and sulfur oxidation pathways within one strain of A. ferrooxidans in order to comprehend the full metabolic potential of the pangenome of the genus. Results: Bioinformatic-based metabolic reconstruction supported by microarray transcript profiling and quantitative RT-PCR analysis predicts the involvement of a number of novel genes involved in iron and sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC23270. These include for iron oxidation: cup (copper oxidase-like), ctaABT (heme biogenesis and insertion), nuoI and nuoK (NADH complex subunits), sdrA1 (a NADH complex accessory protein) and atpB and atpE (ATP synthetase F0 subunits). The following new genes are predicted to be involved in reduced inorganic sulfur compounds oxidation: a gene cluster (rhd, tusA, dsrE, hdrC, hdrB, hdrA, orf2, hdrC, hdrB) encoding three sulfurtransferases and a heterodisulfide reductase complex, sat potentially encoding an ATP sulfurylase and sdrA2 (an accessory NADH complex subunit). Two different regulatory components are predicted to be involved in the regulation of alternate electron transfer pathways: 1) a gene cluster (ctaRUS) that contains a predicted iron responsive regulator of the Rrf2 family that is hypothesized to regulate cytochrome aa3 oxidase biogenesis and 2) a two component sensor-regulator of the RegB-RegA family that may respond to the redox state of the quinone pool. Conclusion: Bioinformatic analysis coupled with gene transcript profiling extends our understanding of the iron and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds oxidation pathways in A. ferrooxidans and suggests mechanisms for their regulation. The models provide unified and coherent descriptions of these processes within the type strain, eliminating previous ambiguity caused by models built from analyses of multiple and divergent strains of this microorganism. © 2009 Quatrini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {A total of 75 microorganisms were obtained from high-sulfur content environmental samples using different sulfur sources. Fifty-four of them had the ability to oxidize sulfur at 1% (w/v) in liquid culture, however only three of them AZCT-M125-5, AZCT-M125-6, and AZCT-M125-7 were able to grow autotrophycally using elemental sulfur at concentrations higher than 1 % and up to 9 % (w/v) as energy source. They produce more than 300 mg sulfate/L. Also, these microbial cultures were able to produce sulfate within pH 3 to 7. Analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that microbial cultures AZCT-M125-5 and AZCT-M125-6 were closely related to Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans while identification of AZCT-M125-7 was not possible. According to the results, these three microorganisms can be excellent candidates for the future development of alternative biotechnological processes for the treatment of hazardous wastes containing sulfur.},

	abstract = {Currently more than 90% of the world’s copper is obtained through sulfide mineral processing. Among the copper sulfides, chalcopyrite is the most abundant and therefore economically relevant. However, primary copper sulfide bioleaching is restricted due to high ionic strength raffinate solutions and particularly chloride coming from the dissolution of ores. In this work we describe the chalcopyrite bioleaching capacity of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain Cutipay (DSM 27601) previously described at the genomic level (Travisany et al. (2012) Draft genome sequence of the Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans Cutipay strain, an indigenous bacterium isolated from a naturally extreme mining environment in Northern Chile. J Bacteriol 194:6327–6328). Bioleaching assays with the mixotrophic strain Cutipay showed a strong increase in copper recovery from chalcopyrite concentrate at 50°C in the presence of chloride ion, a relevant inhibitory element present in copper bioleaching processes. Compared to the abiotic control and a test with Sulfobacillus acidophilus DSM 10332, strain Cutipay showed an increase of 42 and 69% in copper recovery, respectively, demonstrating its high potential for chalcopyrite bioleaching. Moreover, a genomic comparison highlights the presence of the 2-Haloacid dehalogenase predicted-protein related to a potential new mechanism of chloride resistance in acidophiles.

	abstract = {Background: Volutin granules appear to be universally distributed and are morphologically and chemically identical to acidocalcisomes, which are electron-dense granular organelles rich in calcium and phosphate, whose functions include storage of phosphorus and various metal ions, metabolism of polyphosphate, maintenance of intracellular pH, osmoregulation and calcium homeostasis. Prokaryotes are thought to differ from eukaryotes in that they lack membrane-bounded organelles. However, it has been demonstrated that as in acidocalcisomes, the calcium and polyphosphate-rich intracellular "volutin granules (polyphosphate bodies)" in two bacterial species, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Rhodospirillum rubrum, are membrane bound and that the vacuolar proton-translocating pyrophosphatases (V-H+PPases) are present in their surrounding membranes. Volutin granules and acidocalcisomes have been found in organisms as diverse as bacteria and humans.Results: Here, we show volutin granules also occur in Archaea and are, therefore, present in the three superkingdoms of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya). Molecular analyses of V-H+PPase pumps, which acidify the acidocalcisome lumen and are diagnostic proteins of the organelle, also reveal the presence of this enzyme in all three superkingdoms suggesting it is ancient and universal. Since V-H+PPase sequences contained limited phylogenetic signal to fully resolve the ancestral nodes of the tree, we investigated the divergence of protein domains in the V-H+PPase molecules. Using Protein family (Pfam) database, we found a domain in the protein, PF03030. The domain is shared by 31 species in Eukarya, 231 in Bacteria, and 17 in Archaea. The universal distribution of the V-H+PPase PF03030 domain, which is associated with the V-H+PPase function, suggests the domain and the enzyme were already present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).Conclusion: The importance of the V-H+PPase function and the evolutionary dynamics of these domains support the early origin of the acidocalcisome organelle. In particular, the universality of volutin granules and presence of a functional V-H+PPase domain in the three superkingdoms of life reveals that the acidocalcisomes may have appeared earlier than the divergence of the superkingdoms. This result is remarkable and highlights the possibility that a high degree of cellular compartmentalization could already have been present in the LUCA.Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Anthony Poole, Lakshminarayan Iyer and Daniel Kahn. © 2011 Seufferheld et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a usual member of dog's mouths flora that causes rare but dramatic human infections after dog bites. We determined the structure of C. canimorsus lipid A. The main features are that it is penta-acylated and composed of a "hybrid backbone" lacking the 4′ phosphate and having a 1 phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn) at 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose (GlcN). C. canimorsus LPS was 100 fold less endotoxic than Escherichia coli LPS. Surprisingly, C. canimorsus lipid A was 20,000 fold less endotoxic than the C. canimorsus lipid A-core. This represents the first example in which the core-oligosaccharide dramatically increases endotoxicity of a low endotoxic lipid A. The binding to human myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) was dramatically increased upon presence of the LPS core on the lipid A, explaining the difference in endotoxicity. Interaction of MD-2, cluster of differentiation antigen 14 (CD14) or LPS-binding protein (LBP) with the negative charge in the 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) of the core might be needed to form the MD-2 - lipid A complex in case the 4′ phosphate is not present. © 2012 Ittig et al.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is one of the most widely used microorganisms in bioleaching operations to recover copper from low-grade copper sulfide ores. This work aimed to investigate the relative expression of genes related to the iron uptake system when A. ferrooxidans LR was maintained in contact with chalcopyrite or bornite as the sole energy source. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the presence of bornite had no effect on the expression of seven genes related to the siderophore-mediated Fe(III) uptake system, while in the presence of chalcopyrite the expression of the genes was up-regulated. Bioinformatic analysis of the genomic region where these genes were found revealed the existence of three new putative DNA-binding sequences for the ferric iron uptake transcriptional regulator (Fur). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that a purified A. ferrooxidans His-tagged Fur protein was able to bind in vitro to each of these putative Fur boxes, suggesting that Fur regulated the expression of these genes. The expression of fur and two known Fur-regulated genes, mntH and dsrK, was also investigated in the presence of chalcopyrite. While the expression of fur and mntH was up-regulated, the expression of dsrK was down-regulated. The low amount of ferrous iron in the medium was probably responsible for the up-regulation of fur and the genes related to the siderophore-mediated Fe(III) uptake system when A. ferrooxidans LR was kept in the presence of chalcopyrite. A homology model of the A. ferrooxidans Fur was constructed and revealed that the putative DNA-binding surface presents conserved positively charged residues, supporting a previously suggested mode of interaction with DNA. The up-regulation of fur and the siderophore-mediated Fe(III) uptake genes, and the down-regulation of dsrK suggest that in the presence of chalcopyrite Fur acts as a transcription inducer and repressor. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Genome comparison and genome context analysis were used to find a putative mobile element in the genome of Photorhabdus luminescens, an entomopathogenic bacterium. The element is composed of 16-bp direct repeats in the terminal regions, which are identical to a part of insertion sequences (ISs), a DNA methyltransferase gene homolog, two genes of unknown functions and an open reading frame (ORF) (plu0599) encoding a protein with no detectable sequence similarity to any known protein. The ORF (plu0599) product showed DNA endonuclease activity, when expressed in a cell-free expression system. Subsequently, the protein, named R.PluTI, was expressed in vivo, purified and found to be a novel type IIF restriction enzyme that recognizes 5'-GGCG C/C-3' (/ indicates position of cleavage). R.PluTI cleaves a two-site supercoiled substrate at both the sites faster than a one-site supercoiled substrate. The modification enzyme homolog encoded by plu0600, named M.PluTI, was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to protect DNA from R.PluTI cleavage in vitro, and to suppress the lethal effects of R.PluTI expression in vivo.

	abstract = {A taxonomic and annotated functional description of microbial life was deduced from 53 Mb of metagenomic sequence retrieved from a planktonic fraction of the Neotropical high Andean (3,973 meters above sea level) acidic hot spring El Coquito (EC). A classification of unassembled metagenomic reads using different databases showed a high proportion of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (in total read affiliation), and through taxonomic affiliation of 16S rRNA gene fragments we observed the presence of Proteobacteria, micro-algae chloroplast and Firmicutes. Reads mapped against the genomes Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5, Legionella pneumophila str. Corby and Acidithiobacillus caldus revealed the presence of transposase-like sequences, potentially involved in horizontal gene transfer. Functional annotation and hierarchical comparison with different datasets obtained by pyrosequencing in different ecosystems showed that the microbial community also contained extensive DNA repair systems, possibly to cope with ultraviolet radiation at such high altitudes. Analysis of genes involved in the nitrogen cycle indicated the presence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to N2 (narGHI, nirS, norBCDQ and nosZ), associated with Proteobacteria-like sequences. Genes involved in the sulfur cycle (cysDN, cysNC and aprA) indicated adenylsulfate and sulfite production that were affiliated to several bacterial species. In summary, metagenomic sequence data provided insight regarding the structure and possible functions of this hot spring microbial community, describing some groups potentially involved in the nitrogen and sulfur cycling in this environment. © 2012 Jiménez et al.},

	abstract = {We wish to understand how membrane proteins function in extremely acid conditions (<pH1 - pH3) using, as initial models, a predicted aquaporin and a potassium (K+) channel from the acidophile, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. A fundamental question is how these proteins function when confronted by a proton concentration difference of 6 orders of magnitude across the membrane. Similarity alignments were used to find the most similar three dimensional structure for each protein from crystallized orthologs deposited in the protein database PDB and these were used as templates for molecular simulations. Proteins from A. ferrooxidans were submitted to a molecular modeling strategy and their structural and dynamic properties were determined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (20 ns). Aquaporins are a large family of transmembrane channel proteins that allow the passive but selective movement of water, glycerol or CO2 across cell membranes. MD calculations computed key biophysical features related to permeation parameters. K+ channels are membrane proteins that allow voltage-driven potassium flux across cellular membranes. A structural analysis of the A. ferrooxidans K+ channel predicts that it does not expose ionizable amino acids to the external surface. This would reduce protonation of residues at pH 1, permitting tertiary structure to be maintained. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications.},

Bacteria comprise about 30% of microorganisms and are represented primarily by aerobic lithoautotrophs using the energy sources of volcanic origin-thermoacidophilic methanotrophs of the phylum Verrucomicrobia and Acidithiobacillus spp. oxidising metals and reduced sulfur compounds. More than 70% of microbial population in this habitat were represented by archaea, in majority affiliated with "uncultured" lineages. The most numerous group (39% of all archaea) represented a novel division in the phylum Euryarchaeota related to the order Thermoplasmatales. Another abundant group (33% of all archaea) was related to MCG1 lineage of the phylum Crenarchaeota, originally detected in the Yellowstone hot spring as the environmental clone pJP89. The organisms belonging to these two groups are widely spread in hydrothermal environments worldwide. These data indicate an important environmental role of these two archaeal groups and should stimulate the investigation of their metabolism by cultivation or metagenomic approaches. © 2011 Springer.},

	abstract = {The focus of this study is to characterize the bacterial community structure present during stirred-tank bioleaching of a low-grade nickel sulphide ore at different temperatures (5 to 45 °C) and pH levels (3 and 5). This is a continuation of previous work, which was designed to assess the technical feasibility of applying elevated-pH bioleaching to this same ore from Manitoba, Canada. A combination of classical microbiological and molecular biological techniques has been used to identify and enumerate the members of the bacterial consortia over the course of the five-week experiments. DGGE analysis revealed the presence of at least 16 distinct 16S rRNA gene sequences, 14 of which are closely related to existing GenBank sequences. Two sequences were detected that are not closely related to existing GenBank sequences and may possibly be from novel species. Thirteen sequences are related to gene sequences of genera that have previously been detected in bioleaching environments (Acidithiobacillus, Leptospirillum, Sulfobacillus, Acidiphilium, Ferrimicrobium, and Acidimicrobium). Members from the genus Acidithiobacillus were dominant at all temperatures except 45 °C, at which Sulfobacillus spp. were dominant. Many of the acidithiobacilli are most closely related to strains of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, and different strains were dominant under different experimental conditions, indicating considerable phenotypic heterogeneity within the species. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) cell-cell communication systems are utilized by bacteria to coordinate their behaviour according to cell density. Several different types of QS signal molecules have been identified, among which acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) produced by Proteobacteria have been studied to the greatest extent. Although QS has been studied extensively in cultured microorganisms, little is known about the QS systems of uncultured microorganisms and the roles of these systems in microbial communities. To extend our knowledge of QS systems and to better understand the signalling that takes place in the natural environment, metagenomic libraries constructed using DNA from activated sludge and soil were screened, using an Agrobacterium biosensor strain, for novel QS synthase genes. Three cosmids (QS6-1, QS10-1 and QS10-2) that encode the production of QS signals were identified and DNA sequence analysis revealed that all three clones encode a novel luxI family AHL synthase and a luxR family transcriptional regulator. Thin layer chromatography revealed that these LuxI homologue proteins are able to synthesize multiple AHL signals. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that LuxIQS6-1 directs the synthesis of at least three AHLs, 3-O-C14:1 HSL, 3-O-C16:1 HSL and 3-O-C14 HSL; LuxIQS10-1 directs the synthesis of at least 3-O-C12 HSL and 3-O-C14 HSL; while LuxIQS10-2 directs the synthesis of at least C8 HSL and C10 HSL. Two possible new AHLs, C14:3 HSL and (?)-hydroxymethyl-3-O- C14 HSL, were also found to be synthesized by LuxIQS6-1. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Boiling Springs Lake (BSL) in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, is North America's largest hot spring, but little is known about the physical, chemical, and biological features of the system. Using a remotely operated vessel, we characterized the bathymetry and near-surface temperatures at sub-meter resolution. The majority of the 1.2 ha, pH 2.2 lake is 10 m deep and 50-52 °C, but temperatures reach 93 °C locally. We extracted DNA from water and sediments collected from warm (52 °C) and hot (73-83 °C) sites separated by 180 m. Gene clone libraries and functional gene microarray (GeoChip 3.0) were used to investigate the BSL community, and uptake of radiolabeled carbon sources was used to assess the relative importance of heterotrophic vs. autotrophic production. Microbial assemblages are similar in both sites despite the strong temperature differential, supporting observations of a dynamic, convectively mixed system. Bacteria in the Actinobacteria and Aquificales phyla are abundant in the water column, and Archaea distantly related to known taxa are abundant in sediments. The functional potential appears similar across a 5-year time span, indicating a stable community with little inter-annual variation, despite the documented seasonal temperature cycle. BSL water-derived DNA contains genes for complete C, N, and S cycles, and low hybridization to probes for N and S oxidation suggests that reductive processes dominate. Many of the detected genes for these processes were from uncultivated bacteria, suggesting novel organisms are responsible for key ecosystem services. Selection imposed by low nutrients, low pH, and high temperature appear to result in low diversity and evenness of genes for key functions involved in C, N, and S cycling. Conversely, organic degradation genes appear to be functionally redundant, and the rapid assimilation of radiolabeled organic carbon into BSL cells suggests the importance of allochthonous C fueling heterotrophic production in the BSL C cycle. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are self-transferred mobile genetic elements that contribute to horizontal gene transfer. An ICE (ICEAfe1) was identified in the genome of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. Excision of the element and expression of relevant genes under normal and DNA-damaging growth conditions was analyzed. Bioinformatic tools and DNA amplification methods were used to identify and to assess the excision and expression of genes related to the mobility of the element. Both basal and mitomycin C-inducible excision as well as expression and induction of the genes for integration/excision are demonstrated, suggesting that ICEAfe1 is an actively excising SOS-regulated mobile genetic element. The presence of a complete set of genes encoding self-transfer functions that are induced in response to DNA damage caused by mitomycin C additionally suggests that this element is capable of conjugative transfer to suitable recipient strains. Transfer of ICEAfe1 may provide selective advantages to other acidophiles in this ecological niche through dissemination of gene clusters expressing transfer RNAs, CRISPRs, and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, probably by modification of translation efficiency, resistance to bacteriophage infection and biofilm formation, respectively. These data open novel avenues of research on conjugative transformation of biotechnologically relevant microorganisms recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

	abstract = {A mesophilic, neutrophilic and aerobic, ammonia-oxidizing archaeon, strain EN76T, was isolated from garden soil in Vienna (Austria). Cells were irregular cocci with a diameter of 0.6-0.9 μm and possessed archaella and archaeal pili as cell appendages. Electron microscopy also indicated clearly discernible areas of high and low electron density, as well as tubule-like structures. Strain EN76T had an S-layer with p3 symmetry, so far only reported for members of the Sulfolobales. Crenarchaeol was the major core lipid. The organism gained energy by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite aerobically, thereby fixing CO2, but growth depended on the addition of small amounts of organic acids. The optimal growth temperature was 42 °C and the optimal pH was 7.5, with ammonium and pyruvate concentrations of 2.6 and 1 mM, respectively. The genome of strain EN76T had a DNA G+C content of 52.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA genes showed that strain EN76T is affiliated with the recently proposed phylum Thaumarchaeota, sharing 85 % 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with the closest cultivated relative 'Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus' SCM1, a marine ammonia-oxidizing archaeon, and a maximum of 81 % 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with members of the phyla Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota and any of the other recently proposed phyla (e.g. 'Korarchaeota' and 'Aigarchaeota'). We propose the name Nitrososphaera viennensis gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate strain EN76T. The type strain of Nitrososphaera viennensis is strain EN76T (= DSM 26422T = JMC 19564T).

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are subject to a number of anthropogenic disturbances, including environmental toxicants. The efficient monitoring of water resources is fundamental for effective management of water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Spot sampling and continuous water quality monitoring based on physicochemical factors are conducted to assess water quality. However, not all contaminants or synergistic and antagonistic toxic effects can be determined by solely analyzing the physicochemical factors. Thus, various biotests have been developed using long-term and automatic observation studies based on the ability of the aquatic organisms to continuously sense a wide range of pollutants. In addition, a biological early warning system (BEWS) has been developed based on the response behaviors of organisms to continuously detect a wide range of pollutants for effective water quality monitoring and management. However, large amounts of data exhibiting non-linearity and individual behavioral variation are continuously accumulated over long-term and continuous behavioral monitoring studies. Thus, appropriate mathematical and computational data analyses are necessary to manage and interpret such large datasets. Here, we review the development and application of BEWS by using various groups of organisms and the computational methods used to process the behavioral monitoring data. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The sulfur dioxygenase ETHYLMALONIC ENCEPHALOPATHY PROTEIN1 (ETHE1) catalyzes the oxidation of persulfides in the mitochondrial matrix and is essential for early embryo development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We investigated the biochemical and physiological functions of ETHE1 in plant metabolism using recombinant Arabidopsis ETHE1 and three transfer DNA insertion lines with 50% to 99% decreased sulfur dioxygenase activity. Our results identified a new mitochondrial pathway catalyzing the detoxification of reduced sulfur species derived from cysteine catabolism by oxidation to thiosulfate. Knockdown of the sulfur dioxygenase impaired embryo development and produced phenotypes of starvation-induced chlorosis during short-day growth conditions and extended darkness, indicating that ETHE1 has a key function in situations of high protein turnover, such as seed production and the use of amino acids as alternative respiratory substrates during carbohydrate starvation. The amino acid profile of mutant plants was similar to that caused by defects in the electron-transfer flavoprotein/electron-transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex and associated dehydrogenases. Thus, in addition to sulfur amino acid catabolism, ETHE1 also affects the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids and lysine. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is chemolithoautotrophic -proteobacterium that thrives at extremely low pH (pH 1-2). Although a substantial amount of information is available regarding CO2uptake and fixation in a variety of facultative autotrophs, less is known about the processes in obligate autotrophs, especially those living in extremely acidic conditions, prompting the present study. Results. Four gene clusters (termed cbb1-4) in the A. ferrooxidans genome are predicted to encode enzymes and structural proteins involved in carbon assimilation via the Calvin-Benson- Bassham (CBB) cycle including form I of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO, EC 4.1.1.39) and the CO2- concentrating carboxysomes. RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that each gene cluster is a single transcriptional unit and thus is an operon. Operon cbb1 is divergently transcribed from a gene, cbbR, encoding the LysR-type transcriptional regulator CbbR that has been shown in many organisms to regulate the expression of RubisCO genes. Sigma70-like -10 and -35 promoter boxes and potential CbbR-binding sites (T-N11-A/TNA-N7TNA) were predicted in the upstream regions of the four operons. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) confirmed that purified CbbR is able to bind to the upstream regions of the cbb1, cbb2 and cbb3 operons, demonstrating that the predicted CbbR-binding sites are functional in vitro. However, CbbR failed to bind the upstream region of the cbb4 operon that contains cbbP, encoding phosphoribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.19). Thus, other factors not present in the assay may be required for binding or the region lacks a functional CbbR-binding site. The cbb3 operon contains genes predicted to encode anthranilate synthase components I and II, catalyzing the formation of anthranilate and pyruvate from chorismate. This suggests a novel regulatory connection between CO 2fixation and tryptophan biosynthesis. The presence of a form II RubisCO could promote the ability of A. ferrooxidans to fix CO2at different concentrations of CO2. Conclusions. A. ferrooxidans has features of cbb gene organization for CO2-assimilating functions that are characteristic of obligate chemolithoautotrophs and distinguish this group from facultative autotrophs. The most conspicuous difference is a separate operon for the cbbP gene. It is hypothesized that this organization may provide greater flexibility in the regulation of expression of genes involved in inorganic carbon assimilation. © 2010 Esparza et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In the case of biomining microorganisms, partial and complete genome information has provided critical clues for unraveling their physiology. This information has also provided genetic material for the generation of functional and biodiversity directed markers. In this work, we present a compilation of the most relevant findings based on genomic analysis of the model organism Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC23270 that were extended and compared to the recently sequenced genomes of Acithiobacillus thiooxidans and Acidithiobacillus caldus. The phylogenetic relatedness of these three microorganisms has permitted the identification of a shared genomic core that encodes the common metabolic and regulatory functions critical for survival and proliferation in extremely acidic environments. We also identified microorganism-specific genomic components that are predicted to be responsible for the metabolic speciation of these microorganisms. Finally, we evaluated the impact of lateral gene transfer on these genomes in order to determine the functional contribution of this phenomenon to the fitness of these microbial representatives. The information gathered by genomic analyses in the Acidithiobacillus genus will be presented in conjunction with other biomining genomic and metagenomic information in order to generate a more comprehensive picture of the biodiversity, metabolism and ecophysiology of the bioleaching niche. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications.},

PDWY is present in Gram-positive bacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus and haloarchaea, and PVWY in b- and g-Proteobacteria. PPWF only exists in Archaea. Distinct patterns for acidophilic organisms indicate environment-specific adaptations. Importantly, the presence of PDWY and PEWY is correlated with the redox potential of Rieske ISP and quinone species.We propose that during evolution from low to high potential electron-transfer systems in the emerging oxygenic atmosphere, cyt bc1 complexes withPEWYasQomotifprevailedtoefficientlyuse high potential ubiquinone as substrate, whereas cyt b with PDWY operate best with low potential Rieske ISP andmenaquinone, with the latter being the likely composition of the ancestral cyt bc1 complex. © The Author(s) 2014.},

	abstract = {A particularly challenging problem in genome annotation is to attribute function to genes annotated as "hypothetical, no known function". These typically account for about 40% of all genes regardless of the genome. Some of these are "orphan" genes and are not found in any other genome. Some of these could encode species specific proteins and so are particularly interesting for evaluating novel metabolic potential and for understanding the evolution of genes and genomes. Several similarity and non-similarity bioinformatics tools exist that help predict function of hypotheticals, but none are able to suggest function for more than a few percent and the annotation of the others remains a formidable task. We have developed a bioinformatics tool called AlterORF (www.AlterORF.cl) that is able to identify alternate open reading frames (ORFs) embedded within annotated genes. Analysis of over 2 million genes in over 700 completely sequenced genomes reveals that alternate ORFs of substantial length (potentially encoding 70 amino acids or more) are surprisingly common, especially in G+C rich genomes. During our examination of these alternate ORFs, we uncovered hundreds of examples where the alternate ORF has a significant hit with databases of motifs and domains (e.g. CDD, Pfam) and where the actual annotated gene is described as hypothetical and has no database match. This strongly suggests that the annotated gene has been incorrectly identified and that the alternate ORF is the real gene. We describe the evaluation of the following genomes of bioleaching microorganisms and others that reside in similar ecological niches using AlterORF: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (2 strains), Leptospirillum type II, Methylacidiphilum infernorum, Picrophilus torridus, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, S. solfataricus, S. tokodaii, Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii, Thermoplasma acidophilum and T. volcanium. Examples of novel genes from these microorganisms and their suggested roles in metabolism will be described. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications.},

The organism was isolated from the leaves of a local plant near the Kharagpur railway station, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India. It has been extensively studied for fermentative hydrogen production because of its high hydrogen yield. For further enhancement of hydrogen production by strain development, complete genome sequence analysis was carried out. Sequence analysis revealed that the genome was linear, 4.67 kbp long and had a GC content of 56.01%. The genome properties encode 4,393 protein-coding and 179 RNA genes. Additionally, a putative pathway of hydrogen production was suggested based on the presence of formate hydrogen lyase complex and other related genes identified in the genome. Thus, in the present study we describe the specific properties of the organism and the generation, annotation and analysis of its genome sequence as well as discuss the putative pathway of hydrogen production by this organism. © retained by original authors.},

	abstract = {Protein acidostability is a common problem in biopharmaceutical and other industries. However, it remains a great challenge to engineer proteins for enhanced acidostability because our knowledge of protein acidostabilization is still very limited. In this paper, we present a comparative study of proteins from bacteria with acidic (AP) and neutral cytoplasms (NP) using an integrated statistical and machine learning approach. We construct a set of 393 non-redundant AP-NP ortholog pairs and calculate a total of 889 sequence based features for these proteins. The pairwise alignments of these ortholog pairs are used to build a residue substitution propensity matrix between APs and NPs. We use Gini importance provided by the Random Forest algorithm to rank the relative importance of these features. A scoring function using the 10 most significant features is developed and optimized using a hill climbing algorithm. The accuracy of the score function is 86.01% in predicting AP-NP ortholog pairs and is 76.65% in predicting non-ortholog AP-NP pairs, suggesting that there are significant differences between APs and NPs which can be used to predict relative acidostability of proteins. The overall trends uncovered in the study can be used as general guidelines for designing acidostable proteins. To best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic comparative study of the acidostable proteins and their non-acidostable orthologs. © 2012 Fang et al.},

	abstract = {Summary: Plasmid diversity is still poorly understood in pelagic marine environments. Metagenomic approaches have the potential to reveal the genetic diversity of microbes actually present in an environment and the contribution of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. By searching metagenomic datasets from flow cytometry-sorted coastal California seawater samples dominated by cyanobacteria (SynMeta) and from the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) putative marine plasmid sequences were identified as well as their possible hosts in the same samples. Based on conserved plasmid replication protein sequences predicted from the SynMeta metagenomes, PCR primers were designed for amplification of one plasmid family and used to confirm that metagenomic contigs of this family were derived from plasmids. These results suggest that the majority of plasmids in SynMeta metagenomes were small and cryptic, encoding mostly their own replication proteins. In contrast, probable plasmid sequences identified in the GOS dataset showed more complexity, consistent with a much more diverse microbial population, and included genes involved in plasmid transfer, mobilization, stability and partitioning. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on common replication protein functional domains and, even within one replication domain family, substantial diversity was found within and between different samples. However, some replication protein domain families appear to be rare in the marine environment. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Gram-negative bacterium Variovorax paradoxus strain B4 was isolated from soil under mesophilic and aerobic conditions to elucidate the so far unknown catabolism of mercaptosuccinate (MS). During growth with MS this strain released significant amounts of sulfate into the medium. Tn5::mob-induced mutagenesis was successfully employed and yielded nine independent mutants incapable of using MS as a carbon source. In six of these mutants, Tn5::mob insertions were mapped in a putative gene encoding a molybdenum (Mo) cofactor biosynthesis protein (moeA). In two further mutants the Tn5::mob insertion was mapped in the gene coding for a putative molybdopterin (MPT) oxidoreductase. In contrast to the wild type, these eight mutants also showed no growth on taurine. In another mutant a gene putatively encoding a 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (paaH2) was disrupted by transposon insertion. Upon subcellular fractionation of wild-type cells cultivated with MS as sole carbon and sulfur source, MPT oxidoreductase activity was detected in only the cytoplasmic fraction. Cells grown with succinate, taurine, or gluconate as a sole carbon source exhibited no activity or much lower activity. MPT oxidoreductase activity in the cytoplasmic fraction of the Tn5::mob-induced mutant Icr6 was 3-fold lower in comparison to the wild type. Therefore, a new pathway for MS catabolism in V. paradoxus strain B4 is proposed: (i) MPT oxidoreductase catalyzes the conversion of MS first into sulfinosuccinate (a putative organo-sulfur compound composed of succinate and a sulfino group) and then into sulfosuccinate by successive transfer of oxygen atoms, (ii) sulfosuccinate is cleaved into oxaloacetate and sulfite, and (iii) sulfite is oxidized to sulfate.

This study aimed to investigate the microbial community structural and functional diversity between the two nodes in bioleaching system from Dexing copper mine in Jiangxi province, China. 16SrRNA gene cloning and metagenomic analysis consistently indicated that there were obvious differences on microbial community structural and functional diversity in the two nodes. In leaching heap, the dominant species was the heterotrophic bacterium Acidiphilium; while the dominant species was the autotrophic bacterium Acidithiobacillus in acid mine drainage. Seven bacteria species were found in both two nodes, while the unique bacteria species in leaching heap and acid mine drainage were eleven and eight, respectively. In relation to the microbial community function aspect, all contigs and singlets were annotated against the non-redundant protein database of NCBI and clustering analyzed with COG database. For the two nodes, the COG clustering results showed that the functional category abundances were different, though the functional categories were similar. And the great majority of ORFs were forecasted as function unknown. All the results meant that the microbial community structural and functional diversity of bioleaching system was not as simple as former thought.

	abstract = {Gene transcription (microarrays) and protein levels (proteomics) were compared in cultures of the acidophilic chemolithotroph Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans grown on elemental sulfur as the electron donor under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, using either molecular oxygen or ferric iron as the electron acceptor, respectively. No evidence supporting the role of either tetrathionate hydrolase or arsenic reductase in mediating the transfer of electrons to ferric iron (as suggested by previous studies) was obtained. In addition, no novel ferric iron reductase was identified. However, data suggested that sulfur was disproportionated under anaerobic conditions, forming hydrogen sulfide via sulfur reductase and sulfate via heterodisulfide reductase and ATP sulfurylase. Supporting physiological evidence for H2S production came from the observation that soluble Cu2+ included in anaerobically incubated cultures was precipitated (seemingly as CuS). Since H2S reduces ferric iron to ferrous in acidic medium, its production under anaerobic conditions indicates that anaerobic iron reduction is mediated, at least in part, by an indirect mechanism. Evidence was obtained for an alternative model implicating the transfer of electrons from S0 to Fe3+ via a respiratory chain that includes a bc1 complex and a cytochrome c. Central carbon pathways were upregulated under aerobic conditions, correlating with higher growth rates, while many Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle components were upregulated during anaerobic growth, probably as a result of more limited access to carbon dioxide. These results are important for understanding the role of A. ferrooxidans in environmental biogeochemical metal cycling and in industrial bioleaching operations. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

By coupling a deuterium (D) labeling technique to high mass accuracy untargeted liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) metabolomic analysis, we found that natural acidophilic microbial biofilms dominated by bacteria of the genus Leptospirillum contained unusual lyso phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids in high abundance (more than 10 nmol/mg of dry biomass). The unusual polar head group structure of these lipids is similar to lipids found in phylogenetically unrelated acidophilic chemoautolithotrophs and may be related to the affinity of these lipids for iron and calcium ions. Correlations of lyso phospholipid and proteome abundance patterns suggest a link between the lyso phospholipids and the UBA-type substrain of Leptospirillum group II.

	abstract = {A biochemical, biophysical, and phylogenetic study of the sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR) from the mesophilic gammaproteobacterium Halothiobacillus neapolitanus (HnSOR) was performed in order to determine the structural and biochemical properties of the enzyme. SOR proteins from 14 predominantly chemolithoautotrophic bacterial and archaeal species are currently available in public databases. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that they form a coherent protein family. The HnSOR purified from Escherichia coli after heterologous gene expression had a temperature range of activity of 10 to 99°C with an optimum at 80°C (42 U/mg protein). Sulfite, thiosulfate, and hydrogen sulfide were formed at various stoichiometries in a range between pH 5.4 and 11 (optimum pH 8.4). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering showed that the HnSOR adopts secondary and quaternary structures similar to those of the 24-subunit enzyme from the hyperthermophile Acidianus ambivalens (AaSOR). The melting point of the HnSOR was ≈20°C lower than that of the AaSOR, when analyzed with CD-monitored thermal unfolding. Homology modeling showed that the secondary structure elements of single subunits are conserved. Subtle changes in the pores of the outer shell and increased flexibility might contribute to activity at low temperature. We concluded that the thermostability was the result of a rigid protein core together with the stabilizing effect of the 24-subunit hollow sphere. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.},

We found that gene loss may be the main cause leading to the different numbers of Fur transcription regulators in different Clostridium botulinum strains. Meanwhile, 46 operons were found to be regulated by the Fur transcription regulator in Clostridium botulinum A ATCC 3502, involved in several functional classifications, including iron acquisition, iron utilization, iron transport, and transcription regulator. Under an iron-restricted medium, we experimentally found that a Fur transcription regulator (CBO1372) and two operons (DedA, CBO2610CBO2614 and ABC transporter, CBO0845CBO0847) are shown to be differentially expressed in Clostridium botulinum A ATCC 3502.

	abstract = {Archaea such as Metallosphaera sedula are thermophilic lithoautotrophs that occupy unusually acidic and metal-rich environments. These traits are thought to underlie their industrial importance for bioleaching of base and precious metals. In this study, a genetic approach was taken to investigate the specific relationship between metal resistance and lithoautotrophy during biotransformation of the primary copper ore, chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). In this study, a genetic system was developed for M. sedula to investigate parameters that limit bioleaching of chalcopyrite. The functionalrole of the M. sedula copRTA operon was demonstrated by cross-species complementation of a copper-sensitive Sulfolobus solfataricus copR mutant. Inactivation of the gene encoding the M. sedula copper efflux protein, copA, using targeted recombination compromised metal resistance and eliminated chalcopyrite bioleaching. In contrast, a spontaneous M. sedula mutant (CuR1) with elevated metal resistance transformed chalcopyrite at an accelerated rate without affecting chemoheterotrophic growth. Proteomic analysis of CuR1 identified pleiotropic changes, including altered abundance of transport proteins having AAA-ATPase motifs. Addition of the insoluble carbonate mineral witherite (BaCO3) further stimulated chalcopyrite lithotrophy, indicating that carbon was a limiting factor. Since both mineral types were actively colonized, enhanced metal leaching may arise from the cooperative exchange of energy and carbon between surface-adhered populations. Genetic approaches provide a new means of improving the efficiency of metal bioleaching by enhancing the mechanistic understanding of thermophilic lithoautotrophy. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {The volcanic Sulphur Springs, St. Lucia, present an extreme environment due to high temperatures, low pH values, and high concentrations of sulfate and boron. St. Lucia offers some unique geochemical characteristics that may shape the microbial communities within the Sulphur Springs area. We chose six pools representing a range of geochemical characteristics for detailed microbial community analyses. Chemical concentrations varied greatly between sites. Microbial diversity was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene clone library analyses. With the exception of one pool with relatively low concentrations of dissolved ions, microbial diversity was very low, with Aquificales sequences dominating bacterial communities at most pools. The archaeal component of all pools was almost exclusively Acidianus spp. and did not vary between sites with different chemical characteristics. In the pool with the highest boron and sulfate concentrations, only archaeal sequences were detected. Compared with other sulfur springs such as those at Yellowstone, the microbial diversity at St. Lucia is very different, but it is similar to that at the nearby Lesser Antilles island of Montserrat. While high elemental concentrations seem to be related to differences in bacterial diversity here, similarities with other Lesser Antilles sites suggest that there may be a biogeographical component as well. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

	abstract = {Chemolithoautotrophic acidophilic bacteria, which belong to the genus Leptospirillum, can only grow with Fe(II) as electron donor and oxygen as an electron acceptor. Members of this genus play an important role in bioleaching sulfide ores. We used nearly complete genome sequences of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans (group I), Leptospirillum rubarum, Leptospirillum '5-way CG' (group II) and Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum (group III) to identify cytochromes that are likely involved in electron transfer chain(s). The results show the presence of genes encoding a number of c-type cytochromes (18-20 genes were identified in each species), as well as bd and cbb3 oxidases. Genes encoding cbb3 oxidase are clustered, with predicted genes involved in cbb3 maturation proteins. Duplication of cbb3 encoding genes (ccoNO) was detected in all four genomes. Interestingly, these micro-organisms also contain genes that potentially encode bc1and b6f-like complexes organized into two putative operon structures. To date, the Leptospirillum genus includes the only organisms reported to have genes coding for two different bc complexes. This study provides detailed insights into the components of electron transfer chains of Leptospirillum spp., revealing their conservation among leptospirilla groups and suggesting that there may be a single common pathway for electron transport between Fe(II) and oxygen.

	abstract = {Although the biogeochemistry of the two environmentally hazardous compounds arsenic and sulfide has been extensively investigated, the biological interference of these two toxic but potentially energy-rich compounds has only been hypothesized and indirectly proven. Here we provide direct evidence for the first time that in the photosynthetic model organism Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 the two metabolic pathways are linked by coregulated genes that are involved in arsenic transport, sulfide oxidation, and probably in sulfide-based alternative photosynthesis. Although Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 is an obligate photoautotrophic cyanobacterium that grows via oxygenic photosynthesis, we discovered that specific genes are activated in the presence of sulfide or arsenite to exploit the energy potentials of these chemicals. These genes form an operon that we termed suoRSCT, located on a transposable element of type IS4 on the plasmid pSYSM of the cyanobacterium. suoS (sll5036) encodes a light-dependent, type I sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. The suoR (sll5035) gene downstream of suoS encodes a regulatory protein that belongs to the ArsR-type repressors that are normally involved in arsenic resistance. We found that this repressor has dual specificity, resulting in 200-fold induction of the operon upon either arsenite or sulfide exposure. The suoT gene encodes a transmembrane protein similar to chromate transporters but in fact functioning as an arsenite importer at permissive concentrations. We propose that the proteins encoded by the suoRSCT operon might have played an important role under anaerobic, reducing conditions on primordial Earth and that the operon was acquired by the cyanobacterium via horizontal gene transfer. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Cold tolerant strains of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans play a role in metal leaching and acid mine drainage (AMD) production in northern latitude/boreal mining environments. In this study we used a proteomics and bioinformatics approach to decipher the proteome changes related to sustained growth at low temperatures to increase our understanding of cold adaptation mechanisms in A. ferrooxidans strains. Changes in protein abundance in response to low temperatures (5 and 15°C) were monitored and protein analyses of a psychrotrophic strain (D6) versus a mesophilic strain (F1) showed that both strains increased levels of 11 stress-related and metabolic proteins including survival protein SurA, trigger factor Tig, and AhpC-Tsa antioxidant proteins. However, a unique set of changes in the proteome of psychrotrophic strain D6 were observed. In particular, the importance of protein fate, membrane transport and structure for psychrotrophic growth were evident with increases in numerous chaperone and transport proteins including GroEL, SecB, ABC transporters and a capsule polysaccharide export protein. We also observed that low temperature iron oxidation coincides with a relative increase in the key iron metabolism protein rusticyanin, which was more highly expressed in strain D6 than in strain F1 at colder growth temperatures. We demonstrate that the psychrotrophic strain uses a global stress response and cold-active metabolism which permit growth of A. ferrooxidans in the extreme AMD environment in colder climates. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Chromohalobacter salexigens (formerly Halomonas elongata DSM 3043) is a halophilic extremophile with a very broad salinity range and is used as a model organism to elucidate prokaryotic osmoadaptation due to its strong euryhaline phenotype.Results: C. salexigens DSM 3043's metabolism was reconstructed based on genomic, biochemical and physiological information via a non-automated but iterative process. This manually-curated reconstruction accounts for 584 genes, 1386 reactions, and 1411 metabolites. By using flux balance analysis, the model was extensively validated against literature data on the C. salexigens phenotypic features, the transport and use of different substrates for growth as well as against experimental observations on the uptake and accumulation of industrially important organic osmolytes, ectoine, betaine, and its precursor choline, which play important roles in the adaptive response to osmotic stress.Conclusions: This work presents the first comprehensive genome-scale metabolic model of a halophilic bacterium. Being a useful guide for identification and filling of knowledge gaps, the reconstructed metabolic network iOA584 will accelerate the research on halophilic bacteria towards application of systems biology approaches and design of metabolic engineering strategies. © 2011 Ates et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Antarctic "moss pillars" are lake-bottom biocenoses that are primarily comprised of aquatic mosses. The pillars consist of distinct redox-affected sections: oxidative exteriors and reductive interiors. Batteries of SSU rRNA genotypes of eukaryotes, eubacteria, and cyanobacteria, but no archaea, have been identified in these pillars. However, rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis provides limited information on metabolic capabilities. To investigate the microorganisms that have the potential for CO 2 fixation in the pillars, we studied the genetic diversity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO, EC 4.1.1.39)-an enzyme involved in CO 2 fixation. PCR clone libraries targeting all forms of the RuBisCO large subunit-encoding gene were constructed and 1,092 clones were randomly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that proteobacterial form IA operational RuBisCO units (ORUs) were detected at the same frequency as the cyanobacterial form IB ORUs. Surprisingly, the form IA ORU, which was closely related to the sequences from deep-sea environments, was detected from all moss pillar sections. The form IB ORU related to Bryophyta, considered to be derived from moss, was identical to the sequence of Leptobryum sp. isolated from Lake Hotoke-Ike where the pillars were found. Moreover, certain cyanobacterial ORUs were found exclusively in the exterior of the pillar, whereas form II ORUs related to chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers and purple sulfur bacteria were found exclusively in the interior. No forms IC, ID, or III RuBisCO genes were detected. This is the first report demonstrating that bacteria with the potential for CO 2 fixation and chemoautotrophy are present in the Antarctic moss pillar ecosystem. © 2012 The Author(s).},

The first step for sulfate assimilation, sulfate uptake, has been studied in several bacterial species. This article reviews the properties of different bacterial (and archaeal) transporters for sulfate, molybdate, and related oxyanions. Sulfate uptake is carried out by sulfate permeases that belong to the SulT (CysPTWA), SulP, CysP/(PiT), and CysZ families. The oxyanions molybdate, tungstate, selenate and chromate are structurally related to sulfate. Molybdate is transported mainly by the high-affinity ModABC system and tungstate by the TupABC and WtpABC systems. CysPTWA, ModABC, TupABC, and WtpABC are homologous ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters with similar organization and properties. Uptake of selenate and chromate oxyanions occurs mainly through sulfate permeases. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {We analyzed near-complete population (composite) genomic sequences for coexisting acidophilic iron-oxidizing Leptospirillum group II and III bacteria (phylum Nitrospirae) and an extrachromosomal plasmid from a Richmond Mine, Iron Mountain, CA, acid mine drainage biofilm. Community proteomic analysis of the genomically characterized sample and two other biofilms identified 64.6% and 44.9% of the predicted proteins of Leptospirillum groups II and III, respectively, and 20% of the predicted plasmid proteins. The bacteria share 92% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity and >60% of their genes, including integrated plasmid-like regions. The extrachromosomal plasmid carries conjugation genes with detectable sequence similarity to genes in the integrated conjugative plasmid, but only those on the extrachromosomal element were identified by proteomics. Both bacterial groups have genes for community-essential functions, including carbon fixation and biosynthesis of vitamins, fatty acids, and biopolymers (including cellulose); proteomic analyses reveal these activities. Both Leptospirillum types have multiple pathways for osmotic protection. Although both are motile, signal transduction and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins are more abundant in Leptospirillum group III, consistent with its distribution in gradients within biofilms. Interestingly, Leptospirillum group II uses a methyldependent and Leptospirillum group III a methyl-independent response pathway. Although only Leptospirillum group III can fix nitrogen, these proteins were not identified by proteomics. The abundances of core proteins are similar in all communities, but the abundance levels of unique and shared proteins of unknown function vary. Some proteins unique to one organism were highly expressed and may be key to the functional and ecological differentiation of Leptospirillum groups II and III.

	abstract = {The microbial ecology of the bioleaching of chalcopyrite ores is poorly understood and little effort has been made to handle the microbiological components of these processes. In this study, the composition and structure of microbial communities in acid mineral bioleaching systems have been studied using a PCR-based cloning approach. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments from bacteria was used to evaluate the changes in the bacterial community in the process of chalcopyrite bioleaching in a shaken flask system. The results revealed that the bacterial community was disturbed after the addition of chalcopyrite. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed that the retrieved sequences clustered together with the genera Acidithiobacillus, Leptospirillum, and Acidovorax. Multidimensional scaling analysis of DGGE banding patterns revealed that the process of chalcopyrite bioleaching in 46 days was divided into four stages. In the first stage, Leptospirillum were dominant. In the second stage, Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus groups were mainly detected. In the third and fourth stages, the bacterial community was relatively stable and was dominated by Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus. These results extend our knowledge on the microbial dynamics in chalcopyrite bioleaching, a key issue required to improve commercial applications. © 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Here we conducted systematic genome comparisons and genome context analysis on fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes to detect RM-linked genome rearrangements. RM genes were frequently found to be linked to mobility-related genes such as integrase and transposase homologs. They were flanked by direct and inverted repeats at a significantly high frequency. Insertion by long target duplication was observed for I, II, III and IV restriction types. We found several RM genes flanked by long inverted repeats, some of which had apparently inserted into a genome with a short target duplication. In some cases, only a portion of an apparently complete RM system was flanked by inverted repeats. We also found a unit composed of RM genes and an integrase homolog that integrated into a tRNA gene. An allelic substitution of a Type III system with a linked Type I and IV system pair, and allelic diversity in the putative target recognition domain of Type IIG systems were observed. This study revealed the possible mobility of all types of RM systems, and the diversity in their mobility-related organization. © The Author(s) 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.},

We investigated the population structure, physiology and biogeochemistry of these biofilms using metagenomics, rRNA methods and lipid geochemistry. Snottites from the Frasassi cave system (Italy) are dominated (>70% of cells) by Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, with smaller populations including an archaeon in the uncultivated G-plasma clade of Thermoplasmatales (>15%) and a bacterium in the Acidimicrobiaceae family (>5%). Based on metagenomic evidence, the Acidithiobacillus population is autotrophic (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), carboxysomes) and oxidizes sulfur by the sulfide-quinone reductase and sox pathways. No reads matching nitrogen fixation genes were detected in the metagenome, whereas multiple matches to nitrogen assimilation functions are present, consistent with geochemical evidence, that fixed nitrogen is available in the snottite environment to support autotrophic growth. Evidence for adaptations to extreme acidity include Acidithiobacillus sequences for cation transporters and hopanoid synthesis, and direct measurements of hopanoid membrane lipids. Based on combined metagenomic, molecular and geochemical evidence, we suggest that Acidithiobacillus is the snottite architect and main primary producer, and that snottite morphology and distributions in the cave environment are directly related to the supply of C, N and energy substrates from the cave atmosphere. © 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) is an essential component of the outer monolayer of nearly all Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is composed of a hydrophobic anchor, known as lipid A, an inner core oligosaccharide, and a repeating O-antigen polysaccharide. In nearly all species, the first sugar bridging the hydrophobic lipid A and the polysaccharide domain is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo), and thus it is critically important for LPS biosynthesis. Modifications to lipid A have been shown to be important for resistance to antimicrobial peptides as well as modulating recognition by the mammalian innate immune system. Therefore, lipid A derivatives have been used for development of vaccine strains and vaccine adjuvants. One derivative that has yet to be studied is 8-amino-3,8-dideoxy-Dmanno-octulosonic acid (Kdo8N), which is found exclusively in marine bacteria of the genus Shewanella. Using bioinformatics, a candidate gene cluster for Kdo8N biosynthesis was identified in Shewanella oneidensis. Expression of these genes recombinantly in Escherichia coli resulted in lipid A containing Kdo8N, and in vitro assays confirmed their proposed enzymatic function. Both the in vivo and in vitro data were consistent with direct conversion of Kdo to Kdo8N prior to its incorporation into the Kdo8N-lipid A domain of LPS by a metal-dependent oxidase followed by a glutamate-dependent aminotransferase. To our knowledge, this oxidase is the first enzyme shown to oxidize an alcohol using a metal and molecular oxygen, not NAD(P)+. Creation of an S. oneidensis in-frame deletion strain showed increased sensitivity to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin as well as bile salts, suggesting a role in outer membrane integrity. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	abstract = {In the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the ferric uptake regulator FurA functions as a global transcriptional regulator. Despite several analyses have focused on elucidating the FurA-regulatory network, the number of target genes described for this essential transcription factor is limited to a handful of examples. In this article, we combine an in silico genome-wide predictive approach with experimental determinations to better define the FurA regulon. Predicted FurA-binding sites were identified upstream of 215 genes belonging to diverse functional categories including iron homeostasis, photosynthesis and respiration, heterocyst differentiation, oxidative stress defence and light-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, among others. The probabilistic model proved to be effective at discerning FurA boxes from non-cognate sequences, while subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments confirmed the in vitro specific binding of FurA to at least 20 selected predicted targets. Gene-expression analyses further supported the dual role of FurA as transcriptional modulator that can act both as repressor and as activator. In either role, the in vitro affinity of the protein to its target sequences is strongly dependent on metal co-regulator and reducing conditions, suggesting that FurA couples in vivo iron homeostasis and the response to oxidative stress to major physiological processes in cyanobacteria. © 2014 © The Author(s) 2014.

	abstract = {Given the challenges to life at low pH, an analysis of inorganic sulfur compound (ISC) oxidation was initiated in the chemolithoautotrophic extremophile Acidithiobacillus caldus. A. caldus is able to metabolize elemental sulfur and a broad range of ISCs. It has been implicated in the production of environmentally damaging acidic solutions as well as participating in industrial bioleaching operations where it forms part of microbial consortia used for the recovery of metal ions. Based upon the recently published A. caldus type strain genome sequence, a bioinformatic reconstruction of elemental sulfur and ISC metabolism predicted genes included: sulfide-quinone reductase (sqr), tetrathionate hydrolase (tth), two sox gene clusters potentially involved in thiosulfate oxidation (soxABXYZ), sulfur oxygenase reductase (sor), and various electron transport components. RNA transcript profiles by semi quantitative reverse transcription PCR suggested up-regulation of sox genes in the presence of tetrathionate. Extensive gel based proteomic comparisons of total soluble and membrane enriched protein fractions during growth on elemental sulfur and tetrathionate identified differential protein levels from the two Sox clusters as well as several chaperone and stress proteins up-regulated in the presence of elemental sulfur. Proteomics results also suggested the involvement of heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC) in A. caldus ISC metabolism. A putative new function of Hdr in acidophiles is discussed. Additional proteomic analysis evaluated protein expression differences between cells grown attached to solid, elemental sulfur versus planktonic cells. This study has provided insights into sulfur metabolism of this acidophilic chemolithotroph and gene expression during attachment to solid elemental sulfur. © 2011 Mangold, Valdés, Holmes and Dopson.},

	abstract = {Metabolic modeling provides the means to define metabolic processes at a systems level; however, genome-scale metabolic models often remain incomplete in their description of metabolic networks and may include reactions that are experimentally unverified. This shortcoming is exacerbated in reconstructed models of newly isolated algal species, as there may be little to no biochemical evidence available for the metabolism of such isolates. The phenotype microarray (PM) technology (Biolog, Hayward, CA, USA) provides an efficient, high-throughput method to functionally define cellular metabolic activities in response to a large array of entry metabolites. The platform can experimentally verify many of the unverified reactions in a network model as well as identify missing or new reactions in the reconstructed metabolic model. The PM technology has been used for metabolic phenotyping of non-photosynthetic bacteria and fungi, but it has not been reported for the phenotyping of microalgae. Here, we introduce the use of PM assays in a systematic way to the study of microalgae, applying it specifically to the green microalgal model species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results obtained in this study validate a number of existing annotated metabolic reactions and identify a number of novel and unexpected metabolites. The obtained information was used to expand and refine the existing COBRA-based C. reinhardtii metabolic network model iRC1080. Over 254 reactions were added to the network, and the effects of these additions on flux distribution within the network are described. The novel reactions include the support of metabolism by a number of d-amino acids, l-dipeptides, and l-tripeptides as nitrogen sources, as well as support of cellular respiration by cysteamine-S-phosphate as a phosphorus source. The protocol developed here can be used as a foundation to functionally profile other microalgae such as known microalgae mutants and novel isolates. © 2014 Chaiboonchoe, Dohai, Cai, Nelson, Jijakli and Salehi-Ashtiani.},

	abstract = {The nickel resistance determinant ncrABCY was identified in Leptospirillum ferriphilum UBK03. Within this operon, ncrA and ncrC encode two membrane proteins that form an efflux system, and ncrB encodes NcrB, which belongs to an uncharacterized family (DUF156) of proteins. How this determinant is regulated remains unknown. Our data indicate that expression of the nickel resistance determinant is induced by nickel. The promoter of ncrA, designated pncrA, was cloned into the promoter probe vector pPR9TT, and co-transformed with either a wild-type or mutant nickel resistance determinant. The results revealed that ncrB encoded a transcriptional regulator that could regulate the expression of ncrA, ncrB, and ncrC. A GC-rich inverted repeat sequence was identified in the promoter pncrA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and footprinting assays showed that purified NcrB could specifically bind to the inverted repeat sequence of pncrA in vitro; this was confirmed by bacterial one-hybrid analysis. Moreover, this binding was inhibited in the presence of nickel ions. Thus, we classified NcrB as a transcriptional regulator that recognizes the inverted repeat sequence binding motif to regulate the expression of the key nickel resistance gene, ncrA. © 2011 Zhu et al.},

The 26# strain had a copper-tolerance level of 0.22 mol/L, whereas the DC strain had a lower copper-tolerance level of 0.04 mol/L. The mutant 26# was generated from strain 26#, and its copper-tolerance level was 0.25 mol/L. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, differential expression of the afe_0454 gene during copper ion stress of these three strains was investigated. The results showed that the expression of afe_0454 was increased under copper ion stress, indicating that the afe_0454 gene is sensitive to copper levels. Furthermore, the afe_0454 gene expression ratio varied in the different copper-resistant strains. Gene expression was highest in the highest copper-resistant strain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the afe_0454 gene was 56.87% non-polar, indicating the AFE_0454 protein was hydrophobic. Searching with the AFE_0454 protein in The Institute for Genomic Research database showed that the structure of the copper resistance protein D (CopD), which transports copper ions outside of the cell, had the highest sequence identity (46%). Bioinformatics analysis showed that the AFE_0454 protein has eight transmembrane helixes and was predicted to be localized to the plasma membrane. These results strongly suggested that the AFE_0454 protein is likely a transmembrane protein and might be directly involved in copper ion resistance.},

	abstract = {Anammox bacteria perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and have a unique compartmentalized cell consisting of three membrane-bound compartments (from inside outwards): the anammoxosome, riboplasm, and paryphoplasm. The cell envelope of anammox bacteria has been proposed to deviate from typical bacterial cell envelopes by lacking both peptidoglycan and a typical outer membrane. However, the composition of the anammox cell envelope is presently unknown. Here, we investigated the outermost layer of the anammox cell and identified a proteinaceous surface layer (S-layer) (a crystalline array of protein subunits) as the outermost component of the cell envelope of the anammox bacterium "Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis." This is the first description of an S-layer in the phylum of the Planctomycetes and a new addition to the cell plan of anammox bacteria. This S-layer showed hexagonal symmetry with a unit cell consisting of six protein subunits. The enrichment of the S-layer from the cell led to a 160-kDa candidate protein, Kustd1514, which has no homology to any known protein. This protein is present in a glycosylated form. Antibodies were generated against the glycoprotein and used for immunogold localization. The antiserum localized Kustd1514 to the S-layer and thus verified that this protein forms the "Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartiensis" S-layer. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Chlamydia trachomatis is a medically important pathogen that encodes a relatively high percentage of proteins with unknown function. The three-dimensional structure of a protein can be very informative regarding the protein's functional characteristics; however, determining protein structures experimentally can be very challenging. Computational methods that model protein structures with sufficient accuracy to facilitate functional studies have had notable successes. To evaluate the accuracy and potential impact of computational protein structure modeling of hypothetical proteins encoded by Chlamydia, a successful computational method termed I-TASSER was utilized to model the three-dimensional structure of a hypothetical protein encoded by open reading frame (ORF) CT296. CT296 has been reported to exhibit functional properties of a divalent cation transcription repressor (DcrA), with similarity to the Escherichia coli iron-responsive transcriptional repressor, Fur. Unexpectedly, the I-TASSER model of CT296 exhibited no structural similarity to any DNAinteracting proteins or motifs. To validate the I-TASSER-generated model, the structure of CT296 was solved experimentally using X-ray crystallography. Impressively, the ab initio I-TASSER-generated model closely matched (2.72-Å Cα root mean square deviation [RMSD]) the high-resolution (1.8-Å) crystal structure of CT296. Modeled and experimentally determined structures of CT296 share structural characteristics of non-heme Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, although key enzymatic residues are not conserved, suggesting a unique biochemical process is likely associated with CT296 function. Additionally, functional analyses did not support prior reports that CT296 has properties shared with divalent cation repressors such as Fur. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Changes in the abundance of bacteria and fungi and in the composition of bacterial communities during primary succession were investigated in a brown coal mine deposit area near Sokolov, the Czech Republic, using phospholipid fatty acids analysis, microarray and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The study considered a chronosequence of sites undergoing spontaneous succession: 6-, 12-, 21- and 45-year-old and a 21-year-old site revegetated with Alnus glutinosa. During succession, organic carbon and the total nitrogen content increased while the pH and the C/N ratio decreased. Microbial biomass and bacterial diversity increased until 21 years and decreased later; bacteria dominated over fungi in the initial and late phases of succession. Bacterial community composition of the 6-year-old site with no vegetation cover largely differed from the older sites, especially by a higher content of Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and some Alphaproteobacteria. Bacteria belonging to the genera Acidithiobacillus, Thiobacillus and related taxa, the CO 2 and N 2 fixers, dominated the community at this site. In the later phases, bacterial community development seemed to reflect more the changes in soil nutrient content and pH than vegetation with a decrease of Actinobacteria and an increase of Acidobacteria. The site revegetated with A. glutinosa resembled the 45-year-old primary succession site and exhibited an even lower pH and C/N ratio, indicating that recultivation is able to accelerate soil development. © 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

These microorganisms are known to accelerate the dissolution of sulfur minerals such as pyrite (FeS2), leading to the acid mine drainage generation, a serious pollution problem, that makes these microorganisms essential to the commercial processing of minerals and sulfur. In order to answer this question, the diversity of native acidophilic bacterial species isolated from an acid mine drainage site in Peru was evaluated. The samples were collected from Yanacocha mining (3000 m.a.s.l.) located in the North of Cajamarca region, Yanamina mining (4440 m.a.s.l.) located in the middle of Huancavelica region; finally, SPCC mining (2000 m.a.s.l.) located in the South of Moquegua region. We isolated 11 strains from which three were identified as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, two as At. ferrivorans, two as At. ferridurans, three as Leptospirillum ferrooxidans and one as Acidiphilium sp. by comparative sequencing of PCRamplified 16S rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA genes revealed that some of the strains isolated are closely related to other already known, but there are some with similarities lower than 95 percent.

	abstract = {Transcription termination factor Rho is a ring-shaped, ATP-dependent molecular motor that targets hundreds of transcription units in Escherichia coli. Interest in Rho was renewed recently on the realization that this essential factor is involved in multiple interactions and cellular processes that protect the E. coli genome and regulate its expression on a global scale. Yet it is currently unknown if (and how) Rho-dependent mechanisms are conserved throughout the bacterial kingdom. Here, we mined public databases to assess the distribution, expression and structural conservation of Rho across bacterial phyla. We found that rho is present in more than 90% of sequenced bacterial genomes, although Cyanobacteria, Mollicutes and a fraction of Firmicutes are totally devoid of rho. Genomes lacking rho tend to be small and AT-rich and often belong to species with parasitic/symbiotic lifestyles (such as Mollicutes). By contrast, large GC-rich genomes, such as those of Actinobacteria, often contain rho duplicates and/or encode Rho proteins that bear insertion domains of unknown function(s). Notwithstanding, most Rho sequences across taxa contain canonical RNA-binding and ATP hydrolysis signature motifs, a feature suggestive of largely conserved mechanism(s) of action. Mutations that impair binding of bicyclomycin are present in ~5% of rho sequences, implying that species from diverse ecosystems have developed resistance against this natural antibiotic. Altogether, these findings assert that Rho function is widespread among bacteria and suggest that it plays a particularly relevant role in the expression of complex genomes and/or bacterial adaptation to changing environments. © 2013 SGM.},

The relative expression of metal transport genes was investigated when At. ferrooxidans were cultured in the presence of metal ions, the foundation for studying the molecular mechanism of At. ferrooxidans tolerated high concentration of metal ions was established. The tolerance levels of At. ferrooxidans DC to Mn2+, Zn2+and Cd2+were determined. RT-qPCR were employed to study the differential expression of four metal transport genes (afe_0671, afe_0674, afe_1143 and afe_1144) in At. ferrooxidans strain DC cultured in the presence of Zn2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+. And then, the target genes and proteins encoded by the four genes were analyzed by BLAST bioinformatics software. The results show that the tolerance levels of At. ferrooxidans DC to the stress of Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+are 0.38, 0.18 and 0.08 mol/L, respectively. The differential expressions of the target genes increase under the stress of Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+. The bioinformatics analysis shows that the proteins encoded by target genes are membrane proteins involving in metal transport. These results suggest that the proteins encoded by target genes may be involved in Mn2+, Zn2+and Cd2+ transport in At. ferrooxidans DC.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the depth-dependent geochemistry and microbiology of sediments that have developed via the microbially-mediated oxidation of Fe(II) dissolved in acid mine drainage (AMD), giving rise to a 8-10 cm deep "iron mound" that is composed primarily of Fe(III) (hydr)oxide phases. Chemical analyses of iron mound sediments indicated a zone of maximal Fe(III) reducing bacterial activity at a depth of approximately 2.5 cm despite the availability of dissolved O2 at this depth. Subsequently, Fe(II) was depleted at depths within the iron mound sediments that did not contain abundant O2. Evaluations of microbial communities at 1 cm depth intervals within the iron mound sediments using "next generation" nucleic acid sequencing approaches revealed an abundance of phylotypes attributable to acidophilic Fe(II) oxidizing Betaproteobacteria and the chloroplasts of photosynthetic microeukaryotic organisms in the upper 4 cm of the iron mound sediments. While we observed a depth-dependent transition in microbial community structure within the iron mound sediments, phylotypes attributable to Gammaproteobacterial lineages capable of both Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) reduction were abundant in sequence libraries (comprising ≥20% of sequences) from all depths. Similarly, abundances of total cells and culturable Fe(II) oxidizing bacteria were uniform throughout the iron mound sediments. Our results indicate that O2 and Fe(III) reduction co-occur in AMD-induced iron mound sediments, but that Fe(II)-oxidizing activity may be sustained in regions of the sediments that are depleted in O2. © 2014 Brantner, Haake, Burwick, Menge, Hotchkiss and Senko.

	abstract = {The phylogeny of the large bacterial class Gammaproteobacteria has been difficult to resolve. Here we apply a telescoping multiprotein approach to the problem for 104 diverse gammaproteobacterial genomes, based on a set of 356 protein families for the whole class and even larger sets for each of four cohesive subregions of the tree. Although the deepest divergences were resistant to full resolution, some surprising patterns were strongly supported. A representative of the Acidithiobacillales routinely appeared among the outgroup members, suggesting that in conflict with rRNA-based phylogenies this order does not belong to Gammaproteobacteria; instead, it (and, independently, "Mariprofundus") diverged after the establishment of the Alphaproteobacteria yet before the betaproteobacteria/gammaproteobacteria split. None of the orders Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, or Oceanospirillales were monophyletic; we obtained strong support for clades that contain some but exclude other members of all three orders. Extreme amino acid bias in the highly A+T-rich genome of Candidatus Carsonella prevented its reliable placement within Gammaproteobacteria, and high bias caused artifacts that limited the resolution of the relationships of other insect endosymbionts, which appear to have had multiple origins, although the unbiased genome of the endosymbiont Sodalis acted as an attractor for them. Instability was observed for the root of the Enterobacteriales, with nearly equal subsets of the protein families favoring one or the other of two alternative root positions; the nematode symbiont Photorhabdus was identified as a disruptor whose omission helped stabilize the Enterobacteriales root.

The pathways in MetaCyc are experimentally determined, small-molecule metabolic pathways and are curated from the primary scientific literature. With more than 1400 pathways, MetaCyc is the largest collection of metabolic pathways currently available. Pathways reactions are linked to one or more well-characterized enzymes, and both pathways and enzymes are annotated with reviews, evidence codes, and literature citations. BioCyc (BioCyc.org) is a collection of more than 500 organism-specific Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs). Each BioCyc PGDB contains the full genome and predicted metabolic network of one organism. The network, which is predicted by the Pathway Tools software using MetaCyc as a reference, consists of metabolites, enzymes, reactions and metabolic pathways. BioCyc PGDBs also contain additional features, such as predicted operons, transport systems, and pathway hole-fillers. The BioCyc Web site offers several tools for the analysis of the PGDBs, including Omics Viewers that enable visualization of omics datasets on two different genome-scale diagrams and tools for comparative analysis.

	abstract = {After several decades of use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in weed killers such as Roundup, in fields, forests, and gardens, the biochemical pathway of transformation of glyphosate phosphorus to a useful phosphorus source for microorganisms has been disclosed. Glyphosate is a member of a large group of chemicals, phosphonic acids or phosphonates, which are characterized by a carbon-phosphorus bond. This is in contrast to the general phosphorus compounds utilized and metabolized by microorganisms. Here phosphorus is found as phosphoric acid or phosphate ion, phosphoric acid esters, or phosphoric acid anhydrides. The latter compounds contain phosphorus that is bound only to oxygen. Hydrolytic, oxidative, and radical-based mechanisms for carbonphosphorus bond cleavage have been described. This review deals with the radical-based mechanism employed by the carbon-phosphorus lyase of the carbon-phosphorus lyase pathway, which involves reactions for activation of phosphonate, carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage, and further chemical transformation before a useful phosphate ion is generated in a series of seven or eight enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The phn genes, encoding the enzymes for this pathway, are widespread among bacterial species. The processes are described with emphasis on glyphosate as a substrate. Additionally, the catabolism of glyphosate is intimately connected with that of aminomethylphosphonate, which is also treated in this review. Results of physiological and genetic analyses are combined with those of bioinformatics analyses. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The Aquificales are thermophilic microorganisms that inhabit hydrothermal systems worldwide and are considered one of the earliest lineages of the domain Bacteria. We analyzed metagenome sequence obtained from six thermal "filamentous streamer" communities (40 Mbp per site), which targeted three different groups of Aquificales found in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Unassembled metagenome sequence and PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed that acidic, sulfidic sites were dominated by Hydrogenobaculum (Aquificaceae) populations, whereas the circum-neutral pH (6.5-7.8) sites containing dissolved sulfide were dominated by Sulfurihydrogenibium spp. (Hydrogenothermaceae). Thermocrinis (Aquificaceae) populations were found primarily in the circum-neutral sites with undetectable sulfide, and to a lesser extent in one sulfidic system at pH 8. Phylogenetic analysis of assembled sequence containing 16S rRNA genes as well as conserved protein-encoding genes revealed that the composition and function of these communities varied across geochemical conditions. Each Aquificales lineage contained genes for CO2 fixation by the reverse-TCA cycle, but only the Sulfurihydrogenibium populations perform citrate cleavage using ATP citrate lyase (Acl). The Aquificaceae populations use an alternative pathway catalyzed by two separate enzymes, citryl-CoA synthetase (Ccs), and citryl-CoA lyase (Ccl). All three Aquificales lineages contained evidence of aerobic respiration, albeit due to completely different types of heme Cu oxidases (subunit I) involved in oxygen reduction. The distribution of Aquificales populations and differences among functional genes involved in energy generation and electron transport is consistent with the hypothesis that geochemical parameters (e.g., pH, sulfide, H2, O2) have resulted in niche specialization among members of the Aquificales. © 2013 Takacs-Vesbach, Inskeep, Jay, Herrgard, Rusch, Tringe, Kozubal, Hamamura, Macur, Fouke, Reysenbach, McDermott, Jennings, Hengartner and Xie.},

	abstract = {Peroxisomes are single membrane bound compartments. They are thought to be present in almost all eukaryotic cells, although the bulk of our knowledge about peroxisomes has been generated from only a handful of model organisms. Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized cytosolically and posttranslationally imported into the peroxisomal matrix. The import is generally thought to be mediated by two different targeting signals. These are respectively recognized by the two import receptor proteins Pex5 and Pex7, which facilitate transport across the peroxisomal membrane. Here, we show the first in vivo localization studies of peroxisomes in a representative organism of the ecologically relevant group of diatoms using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. By expression of various homologous and heterologous fusion proteins we demonstrate that targeting of Phaeodactylum tricornutum peroxisomal matrix proteins is mediated only by PTS1 targeting signals, also for proteins that are in other systems imported via a PTS2 mode of action. Additional in silico analyses suggest this surprising finding may also apply to further diatoms. Our data suggest that loss of the PTS2 peroxisomal import signal is not reserved to Caenorhabditis elegans as a single exception, but has also occurred in evolutionary divergent organisms. Obviously, targeting switching from PTS2 to PTS1 across different major eukaryotic groups might have occurred for different reasons. Thus, our findings question the widespread assumption that import of peroxisomal matrix proteins is generally mediated by two different targeting signals. Our results implicate that there apparently must have been an event causing the loss of one targeting signal even in the group of diatoms. Different possibilities are discussed that indicate multiple reasons for the detected targeting switching from PTS2 to PTS1. © 2011 Gonzalez et al.},

	abstract = {Thiol/disulfide systems are involved in the maintenance of the redox status of proteins and other molecules that contain thiol/disulfide groups. Leptospirillum ferriphilum DSM14647, an acidophilic bacterium that uses Fe2+ as electron donor, and withstands very high concentrations of iron and other redox active metals, is a good model to study how acidophiles preserve the thiol/disulfide balance. We studied the composition of thiol/disulfide systems and their role in the oxidative stress response in this extremophile bacterium. Bioinformatic analysis using genomic data and enzymatic assays using protein extracts from cells grown under oxidative stress revealed that the major thiol/disulfide system from L. ferriphilum are a cytoplasmic thioredoxin system (composed by thioredoxins Trx and thioredoxin reductase TR), periplasmic thiol oxidation system (DsbA/DsbB) and a c-type cytochrome maturation system (DsbD/DsbE). Upon exposure of L. ferriphilum to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating compounds, transcriptional activation of the genes encoding Trxs and the TR enzyme, which results in an increase of the corresponding activity, was observed. Altogether these data suggest that the thioredoxin-based thiol/disulfide system plays an important role in redox protection of L. ferriphilum favoring the survival of this microorganism under extreme environmental oxidative conditions. © 2012 Norambuena et al.},

	abstract = {Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems are employed to remove SOx gasses that are produced by the combustion of coal for electric power generation, and consequently limit acid rain associated with these activities. Wet FGDs represent a physicochemically extreme environment due to the high operating temperatures and total dissolved solids (TDS) of fluids in the interior of the FGD units. Despite the potential importance of microbial activities in the performance and operation of FGD systems, the microbial communities associated with them have not been evaluated. Microbial communities associated with distinct process points of FGD systems at several coalfired electricity generation facilities were evaluated using culturedependent and -independent approaches. Due to the high solute concentrations and temperatures in the FGD absorber units, culturable halothermophilic/tolerant bacteria were more abundant in samples collected from within the absorber units than in samples collected from the makeup waters that are used to replenish fluids inside the absorber units. Evaluation of bacterial 16S rRNA genes recovered from scale deposits on the walls of absorber units revealed that the microbial communities associated with these deposits are primarily composed of thermophilic bacterial lineages. These findings suggest that unique microbial communities develop in FGD systems in response to physicochemical characteristics of the different process points within the systems. The activities of the thermophilic microbial communities that develop within scale deposits could play a role in the corrosion of steel structures in FGD systems. © 2012 Brown, Brown and Senko.},

	abstract = {The seminal work of Carl Woese and co-workers has contributed to promote the RNA component of the small subunit of the ribosome (SSU rRNA) as a "gold standard" of modern prokaryotic taxonomy and systematics, and an essential tool to explore microbial diversity. Yet, this marker has a limited resolving power, especially at deep phylogenetic depth and can lead to strongly biased trees. The ever-larger number of available complete genomes now calls for a novel standard dataset of robust protein markers that may complement SSU rRNA. In this respect, concatenation of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) is being growingly used to reconstruct large-scale prokaryotic phylogenies, but their suitability for systematic and/or taxonomic purposes has not been specifically addressed. Using Proteobacteria as a case study, we show that amino acid and nucleic acid r-protein sequences contain a reliable phylogenetic signal at a wide range of taxonomic depths, which has not been totally blurred by mutational saturation or horizontal gene transfer. The use of accurate evolutionary models and reconstruction methods allows overcoming most tree reconstruction artefacts resulting from compositional biases and/or fast evolutionary rates. The inferred phylogenies allow clarifying the relationships among most proteobacterial orders and families, along with the position of several unclassified lineages, suggesting some possible revisions of the current classification. In addition, we investigate the root of the Proteobacteria by considering the time-variation of nucleic acid composition of r-protein sequences and the information carried by horizontal gene transfers, two approaches that do not require the use of an outgroup and limit tree reconstruction artefacts. Altogether, our analyses indicate that r-proteins may represent a promising standard for prokaryotic taxonomy and systematics. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This paper makes two claims: (1) autism can be characterized as a chronic lowgrade encephalopathy, associated with excess exposure to nitric oxide, ammonia and glutamate in the central nervous system, which leads to hippocampal pathologies and resulting cognitive impairment, and (2), encephalitis is provoked by a systemic deficiency in sulfate, but associated seizures and fever support sulfate restoration. We argue that impaired synthesis of cholesterol sulfate in the skin and red blood cells, catalyzed by sunlight and nitric oxide synthase enzymes, creates a state of colloidal instability in the blood manifested as a low zeta potential and increased interfacial stress. Encephalitis, while life-threatening, can result in partial renewal of sulfate supply, promoting neuronal survival. Research is cited showing how taurine may not only help protect neurons from hypochlorite exposure, but also provide a source for sulfate renewal. Several environmental factors can synergistically promote the encephalopathy of autism, including the herbicide, glyphosate, aluminum, mercury, lead, nutritional deficiencies in thiamine and zinc, and yeast overgrowth due to excess dietary sugar. Given these facts, dietary and lifestyle changes, including increased sulfur ingestion, organic whole foods, increased sun exposure, and avoidance of toxins such as aluminum, mercury, and lead, may help to alleviate symptoms or, in some instances, to prevent autism altogether. © 2013 by the authors.},

A combined bioinformatic, transcript profiling, and proteomic approach was used to elucidate iron homeostasis mechanisms in "F. acidarmanus" Fer1 and F. acidiphilum YT. Bioinformatic analysis of the "F. acidarmanus" Fer1 genome sequence revealed genes encoding proteins hypothesized to be involved in iron-dependent gene regulation and siderophore biosynthesis; the Fhu and NRAMP cation acquisition systems; iron storage proteins; and the SUF machinery for the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters. A subset of homologous genes was identified on the F. acidiphilum YT chromosome by direct PCR probing. In both strains, some of the genes appeared to be regulated in a ferrous/ferric iron-dependent manner, as indicated by RT-PCR. A detailed gel-based proteomics analysis of responses to iron depletion showed that a putative isochorismatase, presumably involved in siderophore biosynthesis, and the SufBCD system were upregulated under iron-limiting conditions. No evidence was obtained for iron sparing response during iron limitation.

	abstract = {DNA methylation is involved in a diversity of processes in bacteria, including maintenance of genome integrity and regulation of gene expression. Here, using Caulobacter crescentus as a model, we exploit genome-wide experimental methods to uncover the functions of CcrM, a DNA methyltransferase conserved in most Alphaproteobacteria. Using single molecule sequencing, we provide evidence that most CcrM target motifs (GANTC) switch from a fully methylated to a hemi-methylated state when they are replicated, and back to a fully methylated state at the onset of cell division. We show that DNA methylation by CcrM is not required for the control of the initiation of chromosome replication or for DNA mismatch repair. By contrast, our transcriptome analysis shows that >10% of the genes are misexpressed in cells lacking or constitutively over-expressing CcrM. Strikingly, GANTC methylation is needed for the efficient transcription of dozens of genes that are essential for cell cycle progression, in particular for DNA metabolism and cell division. Many of them are controlled by promoters methylated by CcrM and co-regulated by other global cell cycle regulators, demonstrating an extensive cross talk between DNA methylation and the complex regulatory network that controls the cell cycle of C. crescentus and, presumably, of many other Alphaproteobacteria. © The Author(s) 2013.

	abstract = {Buried within the genomes of many microorganisms are genetic elements that encode rare-cutting homing endonucleases that assist in the mobility of the elements that encode them, such as the self-splicing group I and II introns and in some cases inteins. There are several different families of homing endonucleases and their ability to initiate and target specific sequences for lateral transfers makes them attractive reagents for gene targeting. Homing endonucleases have been applied in promoting DNA modification or genome editing such as gene repair or "gene knockouts". This review examines the categories of homing endonucleases that have been described so far and their possible applications to biotechnology. Strategies to engineer homing endonucleases to alter target site specificities will also be addressed. Alternatives to homing endonucleases such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, triplex forming oligonucleotide nucleases, and targetrons are also briefly discussed. © 2012 Published by NRC Research Press.},

	abstract = {Acid mine drainage of the Carnoulès mine (France) is characterized by acid waters containing high concentrations of arsenic and iron. In the first 30 m along the Reigous, a small creek draining the site, more than 38% of the dissolved arsenic was removed by co-precipitation with Fe(III), in agreement with previous studies, which suggest a role of microbial activities in the co-precipitation of As(III) and As(V) with Fe(III) and sulfate. To investigate how this particular ecosystem functions, the bacterial community was characterized in water and sediments by 16S rRNA encoding gene library analysis. Based on the results obtained using a metaproteomic approach on sediments combined with high-sensitivity HPLC-chip spectrometry, several GroEL orthologs expressed by the community were characterized, and the active members of the prokaryotic community inhabiting the creek sediments were identified. Many of these bacteria are β-proteobacteria such as Gallionella and Thiomonas, but γ-proteobacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and α-proteobacteria such as Acidiphilium, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were also detected. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: Acidithiobacillus caldus is a sulfur oxidizing extreme acidophile and the only known mesothermophile within the Acidithiobacillales. As such, it is one of the preferred microbes for mineral bioprocessing at moderately high temperatures. In this study, we explore the genomic diversity of A. caldus strains using a combination of bioinformatic and experimental techniques, thus contributing first insights into the elucidation of the species pangenome. Principal Findings: Comparative sequence analysis of A. caldus ATCC 51756 and SM-1 indicate that, despite sharing a conserved and highly syntenic genomic core, both strains have unique gene complements encompassing nearly 20% of their respective genomes. The differential gene complement of each strain is distributed between the chromosomal compartment, one megaplasmid and a variable number of smaller plasmids, and is directly associated to a diverse pool of mobile genetic elements (MGE). These include integrative conjugative and mobilizable elements, genomic islands and insertion sequences. Some of the accessory functions associated to these MGEs have been linked previously to the flexible gene pool in microorganisms inhabiting completely different econiches. Yet, others had not been unambiguously mapped to the flexible gene pool prior to this report and clearly reflect strain-specific adaption to local environmental conditions. Significance: For many years, and because of DNA instability at low pH and recurrent failure to genetically transform acidophilic bacteria, gene transfer in acidic environments was considered negligible. Findings presented herein imply that a more or less conserved pool of actively excising MGEs occurs in the A. caldus population and point to a greater frequency of gene exchange in this econiche than previously recognized. Also, the data suggest that these elements endow the species with capacities to withstand the diverse abiotic and biotic stresses of natural environments, in particular those associated with its extreme econiche. © 2013 Acuña et al.},

	abstract = {By their metabolic activities, microorganisms have a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles of elements. The complete understanding of these processes requires, however, the deciphering of both the structure and the function, including synecologic interactions, of microbial communities. Using a metagenomic approach, we demonstrated here that an acid mine drainage highly contaminated with arsenic is dominated by seven bacterial strains whose genomes were reconstructed. Five of them represent yet uncultivated bacteria and include two strains belonging to a novel bacterial phylum present in some similar ecosystems, and which was named Candidatus Fodinabacter communificans. Metaproteomic data unravelled several microbial capabilities expressed in situ, such as iron, sulfur and arsenic oxidation that are key mechanisms in biomineralization, or organic nutrient, amino acid and vitamin metabolism involved in synthrophic associations. A statistical analysis of genomic and proteomic data and reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments allowed us to build an integrated model of the metabolic interactions that may be of prime importance in the natural attenuation of such anthropized ecosystems. © 2011 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Seven genes that encode for proteins involved with transport and binding were up-regulated in the presence of CuS. The differential expression of the seven genes was confirmed by real-time PCR. An atomic absorption analysis of the covellite samples showed that the quantity of copper(II) ions in solution changed from zero to approximately 1.11 g/l after 24 h, and the pH changed from 1.8 to 4.0, suggesting that the copper ions in solution and the pH alteration may be responsible, at least in part, for the up-regulation of the transporter genes in the presence of covellite. An in silico protein-protein interaction analysis of the proteins encoded by the seven transporter protein genes, as well as of proteins encoded by genes of the same functional category that are adjacent to the seven genes identified by RAP-PCR, showed that besides the correlated function, the transporter proteins may act in different steps of the bacterial response to covellite. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Rhizobia, the bacterial legume symbionts able to fix atmospheric nitrogen inside root nodules, have to survive in varied environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to analyse the transcriptional response to heat shock of Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099, a rhizobium with a large multipartite genome of 7.6 Mb that nodulates the model legume Lotus japonicus. Using microarray analysis, extensive transcriptomic changes were detected in response to heat shock: 30% of the protein-coding genes were differentially expressed (2067 genes in the chromosome, 62 in pMLa and 57 in pMLb). The highest-induced genes are in the same operon and code for two sHSP. Only one of the five groEL genes in MAFF303099 genome was induced by heat shock. Unlike other prokaryotes, the transcriptional response of this Mesorhizobium included the underexpression of an unusually large number of genes (72% of the differentially expressed genes). This extensive downregulation of gene expression may be an important part of the heat shock response, as a way of reducing energetic costs under stress. To our knowledge, this study reports the heat shock response of the largest prokaryote genome analysed so far, representing an important contribution to understand the response of plant-interacting bacteria to challenging environmental conditions. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

	abstract = {Molecular characterization of subsurface microbial communities in the former Homestake gold mine, South Dakota, was carried out by 16S rDNA sequence analysis using a water sample and a weathered soil-like sample. Geochemical analyses indicated that both samples were high in sulphur, rich in nitrogen and salt, but with significantly different metal concentrations. Microbial diversity comparisons unexpectedly revealed three distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the archaeal phylum Thaumarchaeota, typically identified from marine environments, and one OTU belonging to a potentially novel phylum that fell sister to Thaumarchaeota. To our knowledge this is only the second report of Thaumarchaeota in a terrestrial environment. The majority of the clones from Archaea sequence libraries fell into two closely related OTUs and were grouped most closely to an ammonia-oxidizing, carbon-fixing and halophilic thaumarchaeote genus, Nitrosopumilus. The two samples showed neither Euryarchaeota nor Crenarchaeota members that have often been identified from other subsurface terrestrial ecosystems. Bacteria OTUs containing the highest percentage of sequences were related to sulphur-oxidizing bacteria of the orders Chromatiales and Thiotrichales. Community members of Bacteria from individual Homestake ecosystems were heterogeneous and distinctive to each community, with unique phylotypes identified within each sample. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of cultivation-dependent and -independent methods, this study aimed to elucidate the diversity of microorganisms involved in iron cycling and to resolve their in situ functional links in sediments of an acidic lignite mine lake. Using six different media with pH values ranging from 2.5 to 4.3, 117 isolates were obtained that grouped into 38 different strains, including 27 putative new species with respect to the closest characterized strains. Among the isolated strains, 22 strains were able to oxidize Fe(II), 34 were able to reduce Fe(III) in schwertmannite, the dominant iron oxide in this lake, and 21 could do both. All isolates falling into the Gammaproteobacteria (an unknown Dyella-like genus and Acidithiobacillus-related strains) were obtained from the top acidic sediment zones (pH 2.8). Firmicutes strains (related to Bacillus and Alicyclobacillus) were only isolated from deep, moderately acidic sediment zones (pH 4 to 5). Of the Alphaproteobacteria, Acidocellarelated strains were only isolated from acidic zones, whereas Acidiphilium-related strains were isolated from all sediment depths. Bacterial clone libraries generally supported and complemented these patterns. Geobacterrelated clone sequences were only obtained from deep sediment zones, and Geobacter-specific quantitative PCR yielded 8 × 105 gene copy numbers. Isolates related to the Acidobacterium, Acidocella, and Alicyclobacillus genera and to the unknown Dyella-like genus showed a broad pH tolerance, ranging from 2.5 to 5.0, and preferred schwertmannite to goethite for Fe(III) reduction. This study highlighted the variety of acidophilic microorganisms that are responsible for iron cycling in acidic environments, extending the results of recent laboratorybased studies that showed this trait to be widespread among acidophiles.},

Here, we report the many "opportunitrophic" genetic characteristics and strategies that M. aquaeolei has adopted to promote survival under various environmental conditions. Genome analysis revealed its metabolic potential to utilize oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors, iron as an electron donor, and urea, phosphonate, and various hydrocarbons as alternative N, P, and C sources, respectively. Miscellaneous sensory and defense mechanisms, apparently acquired via horizontal gene transfer, are involved in the perception of environmental fluctuations and antibiotic, phage, toxin, and heavy metal resistance, enabling survival under adverse conditions, such as oil-polluted water. Multiple putative integrases, transposases, and plasmids appear to have introduced additional metabolic potential, such as phosphonate degradation. The genomic potential of M. aquaeolei and its similarity to other opportunitrophs are consistent with its cosmopolitan occurrence in diverse environments and highly variable lifestyles. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Volcanic regions contain a variety of environments suitable for extremophiles. This study was focused on assessing and exploiting the prokaryotic diversity of two microbial communities derived from different Kamchatkian thermal springs by metagenomic approaches. Samples were taken from a thermoacidophilic spring near the Mutnovsky Volcano and from a thermophilic spring in the Uzon Caldera. Environmental DNA for metagenomic analysis was isolated from collected sediment samples by direct cell lysis. The prokaryotic community composition was examined by analysis of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes. A total number of 1235 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and used for taxonomic classification. Most abundant in the samples were members of Thaumarchaeota, Thermotogae, and Proteobacteria. The Mutnovsky hot spring was dominated by the Terrestrial Hot Spring Group, Kosmotoga, and Acidithiobacillus. The Uzon Caldera was dominated by uncultured members of the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group and Enterobacteriaceae. The remaining 16S rRNA gene sequences belonged to the Aquificae, Dictyoglomi, Euryarchaeota, Korarchaeota, Thermodesulfobacteria, Firmicutes, and some potential new phyla. In addition, the recovered DNA was used for generation of metagenomic libraries, which were subsequently mined for genes encoding lipolytic and proteolytic enzymes. Three novel genes conferring lipolytic and one gene conferring proteolytic activity were identified. © 2013 Bernd Wemheuer et al.},

	abstract = {The biomining bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans oxidizes sulfide ores and promotes metal solubilization. The efficiency of this process depends on the attachment of cells to surfaces, a process regulated by quorum sensing (QS) cell-to-cell signalling in many Gram-negative bacteria. At. ferrooxidans has a functional QS system and the presence of AHLs enhances its attachment to pyrite. However, direct targets of the QS transcription factor AfeR remain unknown. In this study, a bioinformatic approach was used to infer possible AfeR direct targets based on the particular palindromic features of the AfeR binding site. A set of Hidden Markov Models designed to maintain palindromic regions and vary non-palindromic regions was used to screen for putative binding sites. By annotating the context of each predicted binding site (PBS), we classified them according to their positional coherence relative to other putative genomic structures such as start codons, RNA polymerase promoter elements and intergenic regions. We further used the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation algorithm (MEME) to further filter out low homology PBSs. In summary, 75 target-genes were identified, 34 of which have a higher confidence level. Among the identified genes, we found afeR itself, zwf, genes encoding glycosyltransferase activities, metallo-beta lactamases, and active transport-related proteins. Glycosyltransferases and Zwf (Glucose 6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase) might be directly involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis and attachment to minerals by At. ferrooxidans cells during the bioleaching process. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a chemolithoautotrophic acidophilic bacterium that obtains its energy from the oxidation of ferrous iron, elemental sulfur, or reduced sulfur minerals. This capability makes it of great industrial importance due to its applications in biomining. During the industrial processes, A. ferrooxidans survives to stressing circumstances in its environment, such as an extremely acidic pH and high concentration of transition metals. In order to gain insight into the organization of A. ferrooxidans regulatory networks and to provide a framework for further studies in bacterial growth under extreme conditions, we applied a genome-wide annotation procedure to identify 87 A. ferrooxidans transcription factors. We classified them into 19 families that were conserved among diverse prokaryotic phyla. Our annotation procedure revealed that A. ferrooxidans genome contains several members of the ArsR and MerR families, which are involved in metal resistance and detoxification. Analysis of their sequences revealed known and potentially new mechanism to coordinate gene-expression in response to metal availability. A. ferrooxidans inhabit some of the most metal-rich environments known, thus transcription factors identified here seem to be good candidates for functional studies in order to determine their physiological roles and to place them into A. ferrooxidans transcriptional regulatory networks. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Halomonas smyrnensis AADT is a halophilic, gram-negative bacterium that can efficiently produce levan from sucrose as carbon source via levansucrase activity. However, systems-based approaches are required to further enhance its metabolic performance for industrial application. As an important step toward this goal, the genome-scale metabolic network of Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM3043, which is considered a model organism for halophilic bacteria, has been reconstructed based on its genome annotation, physiological information, and biochemical information. In the present work, the genome-scale metabolic network of C. salexigens was recruited, and refined via integration of the available biochemical, physiological, and phenotypic features of H. smyrnensis AAD6T. The generic metabolic model, which comprises 1,393 metabolites and 1,108 reactions, was then systematically analyzed in silico using constraints-based simulations. To elucidate the relationship between levan biosynthesis and other metabolic processes, an enzyme-graph representation of the metabolic network and a graph decomposition technique were employed. Using the concept of control effective fluxes, significant links between several metabolic processes and levan biosynthesis were estimated. The major finding was the elucidation of the stimulatory effect of mannitol on levan biosynthesis, which was further verified experimentally via supplementation of mannitol to the fermentation medium. The optimal concentration of 30 g/L mannitol supplemented to the 50 g/L sucrose-based medium resulted in a twofold increase in levan production in parallel with increased sucrose hydrolysis rate, accumulated extracellular glucose, and decreased fructose uptake rate. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

	abstract = {Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium associated with chronic periodontitis. A 2D electrophoretic analysis of the outer membrane of P. gingivalis W50 revealed a dominant train of spots at 40-41 kDa. The proteins in the train of spots were digested in-gel with trypsin and identified by MS. The train of spots represented two proteins, designated Omp40 and Omp41 that share 47% sequence identity. Preparation of outer membranes in the absence of protease inhibitors resulted in partial cleavage of Omp40 and Omp41 to produce an N-terminal and C-terminal fragment of both proteins. The N-terminal fragments displayed the same isoelectric heterogeneity as the intact proteins. Almost 100% of the amino-acid sequence of these N-terminal fragments in each 2D gel spot was verified suggesting lack of post-translational modification. Re-subjecting a single N-terminal domain spot to 2D electrophoresis resulted in the complete series of spots being reproduced, suggesting that the heterogeneity was related to conformational equilibria. Under reduced conditions and without heating, Omp40 and Omp41 migrated as 34- to 35-kDa proteins in SDS/PAGE whereas under nonreduced conditions the proteins migrated as 70-kDa proteins, suggesting the formation of dimers through intersubunit disulfide bonds. The proteins each contain two cysteine residues in the conserved sequence RPVSCPECPE. Tryptic peptides generated from the nonreduced forms of the proteins confirmed the presence of heterodimers stabilized through intersubunit disulfide bond formation. With the exception of heterodimer formation, the two proteins share several similarities with OmpA-like porins of other Gram-negative bacteria including consensus sequence, abundance, modification by heat, overall length and positioning of domains.},

	abstract = {Background. Iron is an essential nutrient but can be toxic at high intracellular concentrations and organisms have evolved tightly regulated mechanisms for iron uptake and homeostasis. Information on iron management mechanisms is available for organisms living at circumneutral pH. However, very little is known about how acidophilic bacteria, especially those used for industrial copper bioleaching, cope with environmental iron loads that can be 1018 times the concentration found in pH neutral environments. This study was motivated by the need to fill this lacuna in knowledge. An understanding of how microorganisms thrive in acidic ecosystems with high iron loads requires a comprehensive investigation of the strategies to acquire iron and to coordinate this acquisition with utilization, storage and oxidation of iron through metal responsive regulation. In silico prediction of iron management genes and Fur regulation was carried out for three Acidithiobacilli: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (iron and sulfur oxidizer) A. thiooxidans and A. caldus (sulfur oxidizers) that can live between pH 1 and pH 5 and for three strict iron oxidizers of the Leptospirillum genus that live at pH 1 or below. Results. Acidithiobacilli have predicted FeoB-like Fe(II) and Nramp-like Fe(II)-Mn(II) transporters. They also have 14 different TonB dependent ferri-siderophore transporters of diverse siderophore affinity, although they do not produce classical siderophores. Instead they have predicted novel mechanisms for dicitrate synthesis and possibly also for phosphate-chelation mediated iron uptake. It is hypothesized that the unexpectedly large number and diversity of Fe(III)-uptake systems confers versatility to this group of acidophiles, especially in higher pH environments (pH 4-5) where soluble iron may not be abundant. In contrast, Leptospirilla have only a FtrI-Fet3P-like permease and three TonB dependent ferri-dicitrate siderophore systems. This paucity of iron uptake systems could reflect their obligatory occupation of extremely low pH environments where high concentrations of soluble iron may always be available and were oxidized sulfur species might not compromise iron speciation dynamics. Presence of bacterioferritin in the Acidithiobacilli, polyphosphate accumulation functions and variants of FieF-like diffusion facilitators in both Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla, indicate that they may remove or store iron under conditions of variable availability. In addition, the Fe(II)-oxidizing capacity of both A. ferrooxidans and Leptospirilla could itself be a way to evade iron stress imposed by readily available Fe(II) ions at low pH. Fur regulatory sites have been predicted for a number of gene clusters including iron related and non-iron related functions in both the Acidithiobacilli and Leptospirilla, laying the foundation for the future discovery of iron regulated and iron-phosphate coordinated regulatory control circuits. Conclusion. In silico analyses of the genomes of acidophilic bacteria are beginning to tease apart the mechanisms that mediate iron uptake and homeostasis in low pH environments. Initial models pinpoint significant differences in abundance and diversity of iron management mechanisms between Leptospirilla and Acidithiobacilli, and begin to reveal how these two groups respond to iron cycling and iron fluctuations in naturally acidic environments and in industrial operations. Niche partitions and ecological successions between acidophilic microorganisms may be partially explained by these observed differences. Models derived from these analyses pave the way for improved hypothesis testing and well directed experimental investigation. In addition, aspects of these models should challenge investigators to evaluate alternative iron management strategies in non-acidophilic model organisms. © 2008 Osorio et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The distribution and diversity of acidophilic bacteria of a tailings impoundment at the La Andina copper mine, Chile, was examined. The tailings have low sulfide (1.7% pyrite equivalent) and carbonate (1.4% calcite equivalent) contents and are stratified into three distinct zones: a surface (0-70-80 cm) 'oxidation zone' characterized by low-pH (2.5-4), a 'neutralization zone' (70-80 to 300-400 cm) and an unaltered 'primary zone' below 400 cm. A combined cultivation-dependent and biomolecular approach (terminal restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism and 16S rRNA clone library analysis) was used to characterize the indigenous prokaryotic communities in the mine tailings. Total cell counts showed that the microbial biomass was greatest in the top 125 cm of the tailings. The largest numbers of bacteria (109 g-1 dry weight of tailings) were found at the oxidation front (the junction between the oxidation and neutralization zones), where sulfide minerals and oxygen were both present. The dominant iron-/sulfur-oxidizing bacteria identified at the oxidation front included bacteria of the genus Leptospirillum (detected by molecular methods), and Gram-positive iron-oxidizing acidophiles related to Sulfobacillus (identified both by molecular and cultivation methods). Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was also detected, albeit in relatively small numbers. Heterotrophic acidophiles related to Acidobacterium capsulatum were found by molecular methods, while another Acidobacterium-like bacterium and an Acidiphilium sp. were isolated from oxidation zone samples. A conceptual model was developed, based on microbiological and geochemical data derived from the tailings, to account for the biogeochemical evolution of the Piuquenes tailings impoundment. © 2006 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a toxic element commonly found in mining environments. The present study aimed to determine the influence of the indigenous bacterial population on the biogeochemical evolution of arsenic concentration in a mine drainage water. Biological As(III)-oxidizing activity was detected in diverse micro-environments along the water stream, from the source to the discharge point. Laboratory experiments showed that the bacterial population promoted As(III) and Fe(II) oxidation in conditions close to those of the site, i.e., temperature, water composition and oxygen availability. Immobilization of bacteria on pozzolana in a column bioreactor increased oxidation rates compared to on-site natural conditions: As concentration in the bioreactor outlet was less than 50 μg L−1, whereas on-site total As concentration at the discharge point is close to 100 μg L−1. The highest As(III) removal rate in the inoculated column reached 1900 μg L−1 h−1 and As(III) removal rate in the non-inoculated blank column was 42 μg L−1 h−1. Two strains of As(III)-oxidizing bacteria, related to Variovorax paradoxus and Leptothrix cholodnii, were respectively isolated from a laboratory reactor and directly from site sludge. A diverse population of bacteria affiliated to nine phylogenetic groups belonging to the Proteobacteria and to the Bacteroidetes was identified in a laboratory reactor by molecular analyses of 16S rRNA genes. Amongst these, microorganisms already known to be potentially responsible for As(III) or Fe(II) oxidation, as well as for As(V) reduction co-existed: they included members of the genera Gallionella, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium and Methylophilus. On-site experiments confirmed the laboratory results, i.e. the removal of As from the contaminated effluent, and a passive on site treatment is currently developed for improving the quality of the discharged water. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Iron sulfur (Fe/S) proteins are ubiquitous and participate in multiple biological processes, from photosynthesis to DNA repair. Iron and sulfur are highly reactive chemical species, and the mechanisms allowing the multiprotein systems ISC and SUF to assist Fe/S cluster formation in vivo have attracted considerable attention. Here, A-Type components of these systems (ATCs for A-Type Carriers) are studied by phylogenomic and genetic analyses. ATCs that have emerged in the last common ancestor of bacteria were conserved in most bacteria and were acquired by eukaryotes and few archaea via horizontal gene transfers. Many bacteria contain multiple ATCs, as a result of gene duplication and/or horizontal gene transfer events. Based on evolutionary considerations, we could define three subfamilies: ATC-I, -II and -III. Escherichia coli, which has one ATC-I (ErpA) and two ATC-IIs (IscA and SufA), was used as a model to investigate functional redundancy between ATCs in vivo. Genetic analyses revealed that, under aerobiosis, E. coli IscA and SufA are functionally redundant carriers, as both are potentially able to receive an Fe/S cluster from IscU or the SufBCD complex and transfer it to ErpA. In contrast, under anaerobiosis, redundancy occurs between ErpA and IscA, which are both potentially able to receive Fe/S clusters from IscU and transfer them to an apotarget. Our combined phylogenomic and genetic study indicates that ATCs play a crucial role in conveying ready-made Fe/S clusters from components of the biogenesis systems to apotargets. We propose a model wherein the conserved biochemical function of ATCs provides multiple paths for supplying Fe/S clusters to apotargets. This model predicts the occurrence of a dynamic network, the structure and composition of which vary with the growth conditions. As an illustration, we depict three ways for a given protein to be matured, which appears to be dependent on the demand for Fe/S biogenesis. © 2009 Vinella et al.},

	abstract = {Forests play a critical role in sustaining the human environment. Most forest fires not only destroy the natural environment and ecological balance, but also seriously threaten the security of life and property. The early discovery and forecasting of forest fires are both urgent and necessary for forest fire control. This article explores the possible applications of Spatio-temporal Data Mining for forest fire prevention. The research pays special attention to the spatio-temporal forecasting of forest fire areas based upon historic observations. An integrated spatio-temporal forecasting framework - ISTFF - is proposed: it uses a dynamic recurrent neural network for spatial forecasting. The principle and algorithm of ISTFF are presented, and are then illustrated by a case study of forest fire area prediction in Canada. Comparative analysis of ISTFF with other methods shows its high accuracy in short-term prediction. The effect of spatial correlations on the prediction accuracy of spatial forecasting is also explored. © 2008 The Author. Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {We assess the use to which bioinformatics in the form of bacterial genome sequences, functional gene probes and the protein sequence databases can be applied to hypotheses about obligate autotrophy in eubacteria. Obligate methanotrophy and obligate autotrophy among the chemo- and photo-lithotrophic bacteria lack satisfactory explanation a century or more after their discovery. Various causes of these phenomena have been suggested, which we review in the light of the information currently available. Among these suggestions is the absence in vivo of a functional α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The advent of complete and partial genome sequences of diverse autotrophs, methylotrophs and methanotrophs makes it possible to probe the reasons for the absence of activity of this enzyme. We review the role and evolutionary origins of the Krebs cycle in relation to autotrophic metabolism and describe the use of in silico methods to probe the partial and complete genome sequences of a variety of obligate genera for genes encoding the subunits of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Nitrosomonas europaea and Methylococcus capsulatus, which lack the functional enzyme, were found to contain the coding sequences for the E1 and E2 subunits of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Comparing the predicted physicochemical properties of the polypeptides coded by the genes confirmed the putative gene products were similar to the active α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase subunits of heterotrophs. These obligate species are thus genomically competent with respect to this enzyme but are apparently incapable of producing a functional enzyme. Probing of the full and incomplete genomes of some cyanobacterial and methanogenic genera and Aquifex confirms or suggests the absence of the genes for at least one of the three components of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in these obligate organisms. It is recognized that absence of a single functional enzyme may not explain obligate autotrophy in all cases and may indeed be only be one of a number of controls that impose obligate metabolism. Availability of more genome sequences from obligate genera will enable assessment of whether obligate autotrophy is due to the absence of genes for a few or many steps in organic compound metabolism. This problem needs the technologies and mindsets of the present generation of molecular microbiologists to resolve it. © 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

A 16S rRNA gene analysis of these samples was used to distinguish the microbial communities present, of which two distinct communities were identified. The sub-aqueous precipitate, sulfur and microstromatolites showed a predominance of phylotypes related to hydrogen and sulfur-respiring thermophilic microorganisms. The acid-organic material supports an acidophilic mesophilic microbial community with phylotypes related to heterotrophic and phototrophic microorganisms.

The bacterial chemotaxis signal transduction system is the sensory perception system that allows motile cells to respond optimally to changes in environmental conditions by allowing cells to navigate in gradients of diverse physicochemical parameters that can affect their metabolism. The analysis of complete genome sequences from microorganisms that occupy diverse ecological niches reveal the presence of multiple chemotaxis pathways and a great diversity of chemoreceptors with novel sensory specificities. Owing to its role in mediating rapid responses of bacteria to changes in the surroundings, bacterial chemotaxis is a behavior of interest in applied microbiology as it offers a unique opportunity for understanding the environmental cues that contribute to the survival of bacteria.

	abstract = {Metallosphaera sedula is a thermoacidophilic Crenarchaeon which is capable of leaching metals from sulfidic ores. The authors have investigated the presence and expression of genes encoding respiratory complexes in this organism when grown heterotrophically or chemolithotrophically on either sulfur or pyrite. The presence of three gene clusters, encoding two terminal oxidase complexes, the quinol oxidase SoxABCD and the SoxM oxidase supercomplex, and a gene cluster encoding a high-potential cytochrome b and components of a bc1 complex analogue (cbsBA-soxL2N gene cluster) was established. Expression studies showed that the soxM gene was expressed to high levels during heterotrophic growth of M. sedula on yeast extract, while the soxABCD mRNA was most abundant in cells grown on sulfur. Reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra of cell membranes showed cytochrome-related peaks that correspond to published spectra of Sulfolobus-type terminal oxidase complexes. In pyrite-grown cells, expression levels of the two monitored oxidase gene clusters were reduced by a factor of 10-12 relative to maximal expression levels, although spectra of membranes clearly contained oxidase-associated haems, suggesting the presence of additional gene clusters encoding terminal oxidases in M. sedula. Pyrite- and sulfur-grown cells contained high levels of the cbsA transcript, which encodes a membrane-bound cytochrome b with a possible role in iron oxidation or chemolithotrophy. The cbsA gene is not co-transcribed with the soxL2N genes, and therefore does not appear to be an integral part of this bc1 complex analogue. The data show for the first time the differential expression of the Sulfolobus-type terminal oxidase gene clusters in a Crenarchaeon in response to changing growth models. © 2005 SGM.},

We have systematically addressed these questions with respect to phylogenetic footprinting of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in the γ-proteobacteria, and have evaluated the statistical significance of our motif predictions. We used a study set of 166 Escherichia coli genes that have experimentally identified TF binding sites upstream of the gene, with orthologous data from nine additional γ-proteobacteria for phylogenetic footprinting. Just three species were sufficient for ∼74.0% of the motif predictions to correspond to the experimentally reported E. coli sites, and important characteristics to consider when choosing species were phylogenetic distance, genome size, and natural habitat. We also performed simulations using randomized data to determine the critical maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) values for statistical significance of our motif predictions (P = 0.05). Approximately 60% of motif predictions containing sites from just three species had average MAP values above these critical MAP values. The inclusion of a species very closely related to E. coli increased the number of statistically significant motif predictions, despite substantially increasing the critical MAP value.},

	abstract = {A cluster of five genes, proposed to be involved in the formation of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) precursors via the Leloir pathway, have been identified in the acidophilic autotroph Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The order of the genes is luxA-galE-galK-pgm-galM, encoding a LuxA-like protein, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, galactokinase, phosphoglucomutase, and galactose mutarotase, respectively. The gal cluster forms a single transcriptional unit and is therefore an operon. Two other putative genes of the Leloir pathway, galU, potentially encoding UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and a gene designated galT-like, which may encode a galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase-like activity, were found unlinked in the genome. Using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, the genes of the gal operon were shown to be expressed more during growth in iron medium than in growth in sulfur medium. The functions of galE, pgm, galU, and the galT-like gene were validated by complementation of Escherichia coli mutants and by in vitro enzyme assays. The data suggest that A. ferrooxidans is capable of synthesizing the EPS precursors UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose. In addition, genes rfbA, -B, -C, and -D were identified in the genome of A. ferrooxidans, suggesting that it can also synthesize the EPS precursor dTDP-rhamnose. Since EPSs constitute the major bulk of biofilms, this study may provide an initial model for the metabolic pathways involved in biofilm formation in A. ferrooxidans and aid in understanding the role of biofilms in mineral leaching and the formation of acid mine drainage.

	abstract = {We used comparative genomics to investigate the distribution of conserved DNA-binding motifs in the regulatory regions of genes involved in iron and manganese homeostasis in alpha-proteobacteria. Combined with other computational approaches, this allowed us to reconstruct the metal regulatory network in more than three dozen species with available genome sequences. We identified several classes of cis-acting regulatory DNA motifs (Irr-boxes or ICEs, RirA-boxes, Iron-Rhodo-boxes, Fur-alpha-boxes, Mur-box or MRS, MntR-box, and IscR-boxes) in regulatory regions of various genes involved in iron and manganese uptake, Fe-S and heme biosynthesis, iron storage, and usage. Despite the different nature of the iron regulons in selected lineages of alpha-proteobacteria, the overall regulatory network is consistent with, and confirmed by, many experimental observations. This study expands the range of genes involved in iron homeostasis and demonstrates considerable interconnection between iron-responsive regulatory systems. The detailed comparative and phylogenetic analyses of the regulatory systems allowed us to propose a theory about the possible evolution of Fe and Mn regulons in alpha-proteobacteria. The main evolutionary event likely occurred in the common ancestor of the Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales, where the Fur protein switched to regulating manganese transporters (and hence Fur had become Mur). In these lineages, the role of global iron homeostasis was taken by RirA and Irr, two transcriptional regulators that act by sensing the physiological consequence of the metal availability rather than its concentration per se, and thus provide for more flexible regulation. © 2006 Rodionov et al.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the physiology and metabolic complexity of microbial consortia involved in metal solubilization is a prerequisite for the rational improvement of bioleaching technologies. Among the most challenging aspects that remain to be addressed is how aerobic acidophiles, especially Fe(II)-oxidizers, contend with the paradoxical hazards of iron overload and iron deficiency, each with deleterious consequences for growth. Homeostatic mechanisms regulating the acquisition, utilization/oxidation, storage and intracellular mobilization of cellular iron are deemed to be critical for fitness and survival of bioleaching microbes. In an attempt to contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the biology and ecology of the microbial communities in bioleaching econiches, we have used comparative genomics and other bioinformatic tools to reconstruct the iron management strategies in newly sequenced Acidithiobacilli and other biomining genomes available in public databases. Species specific genes have been identified with distinctive functional roles in iron management as well as genes shared by several species in biomining consortia. Their analysis contributes to our understanding of the general survival strategies in acidic and iron loaded environments and suggests functions for genes with currently unknown roles that might reveal novel aspects of iron response in acidophiles. Comprehensive examination of the occurrence and conservation of regulatory functions and regulatory sites also allowed the prediction of the metal regulatory networks for these biomining microbes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

GluRS, HisRS, ArgRS, ThrRS, CysRS, and Glu-Q-RS showed evidence of a complex evolutionary course as indicated by a number of inconsistencies with our reference tree for cyanobacterial phylogeny. In addition to sequence data, support for evolutionary hypotheses involving horizontal gene transfer or gene duplication events was obtained from other observations including biased sequence conservation, the presence of indels (insertions or deletions), or vestigial traces of ancestral redundant genes.

	abstract = {Background: Carbon and nitrogen fixation are essential pathways for autotrophic bacteria living in extreme environments. These bacteria can use carbon dioxide directly from the air as their sole carbon source and can use different sources of nitrogen such as ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, or even nitrogen from the air. To have a better understanding of how these processes occur and to determine how we can make them more efficient, a comparative genomic analysis of three bioleaching bacteria isolated from mine sites in Chile was performed. This study demonstrated that there are important differences in the carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation mechanisms among bioleaching bacteria that coexist in mining environments. Results: In this study, we probed that both Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans incorporate CO2 via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle; however, the former bacterium has two copies of the Rubisco type I gene whereas the latter has only one copy. In contrast, we demonstrated that Leptospirillum ferriphilum utilizes the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for carbon fixation. Although all the species analyzed in our study can incorporate ammonia by an ammonia transporter, we demonstrated that Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans could also assimilate nitrate and nitrite but only Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans could fix nitrogen directly from the air. Conclusion: The current study utilized genomic and molecular evidence to verify carbon and nitrogen fixation mechanisms for three bioleaching bacteria and provided an analysis of the potential regulatory pathways and functional networks that control carbon and nitrogen fixation in these microorganisms. © 2008 Levicán et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the hierarchical computational framework OptStrain aimed at guiding pathway modifications, through reaction additions and deletions, of microbial networks for the overproduction of targeted compounds. These compounds may range from electrons or hydrogen in biofuel cell and environmental applications to complex drug precursor molecules. A comprehensive database of biotransformations, referred to as the Universal database (with >5700 reactions), is compiled and regularly updated by downloading and curating reactions from multiple biopathway database sources. Combinatorial optimization is then used to elucidate the set(s) of non-native functionalities, extracted from this Universal database, to add to the examined production host for enabling the desired product formation. Subsequently, competing functionalities that divert flux away from the targeted product are identified and removed to ensure higher product yields coupled with growth. This work represents an advancement over earlier efforts by establishing an integrated computational framework capable of constructing stoichiometrically balanced pathways, imposing maximum product yield requirements, pinpointing the optimal substrate(s), and evaluating different microbial hosts. The range and utility of OptStrain are demonstrated by addressing two very different product molecules. The hydrogen case study pinpoints reaction elimination strategies for improving hydrogen yields using two different substrates for three separate production hosts. In contrast, the vanillin study primarily showcases which non-native pathways need to be added into Escherichia coil. In summary, OptStrain provides a useful tool to aid microbial strain design and, more importantly, it establishes an integrated framework to accommodate future modeling developments. © 2004 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {The microbial community and sulfur oxygenase reductases of metagenomic DNA from bioreactors treating gold-bearing concentrates were studied by 16S rRNA library, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), conventional cultivation, and molecular cloning. Results indicated that major bacterial species were belonging to the genera Acidithiobacillus, Leptospirillum, Sulfobacillus, and Sphingomonas, accounting for 6.3, 66.7, 18.8, and 8.3%, respectively; the sole archaeal species was Ferroplasma sp. (100%). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers (per gram of concentrates) of bacteria and archaea were 4.59×109 and 6.68×105, respectively. Bacterial strains representing Acidithiobacillus, Leptospirillum, and Sulfobacillus were isolated from the bioreactors. To study sulfur oxidation in the reactors, pairs of new PCR primers were designed for the detection of sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR) genes. Three sor-like genes, namely, sor Fx, sor SA, and sor SB were identified from metagenomic DNAs of the bioreactors. The sor Fx is an inactivated SOR gene and is identical to the pseudo-SOR gene of Ferroplasma acidarmanus. The sor SA and sor SB showed no significant identity to any genes in GenBank databases. The sor SB was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and SOR activity was determined. Quantitative RT-PCR determination of the gene densities of sor SA and sor SB were 1,000 times higher than archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, indicating that these genes were mostly impossible from archaea. Furthermore, with primers specific to the sor SB gene, this gene was PCR-amplified from the newly isolated Acidithiobacillus sp. strain SM-1. So far as we know, this is the first time to determine SOR activity originating from bacteria and to document SOR gene in bioleaching reactors and Acidithiobacillus species. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Ten different antibiotic resistance plasmids conferring high-level erythromycin resistance were isolated from an activated sludge bacterial community of a wastewater treatment plant by applying a transformation-based approach. One of these plasmids, designated pRSB101, mediates resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, roxythromycin, sulfonamides, cephalosporins, spectinomycin, streptomycin, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid and low concentrations of norfloxacin. Plasmid pRSB101 was completely sequenced and annotated. Its size is 47 829 bp. Conserved synteny exists between the pRSB101 replication/partition (rep/par) module and the pXAC33-replicon from the phytopathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri. The second pRSB101 backbone module encodes a three-Mob-protein type mobilization (mob) system with homology to that of IncQ-like plasmids. Plasmid pRSB101 is mobilizable with the help of the IncP-1α plasmid RN4 providing transfer functions in trans. A 20 kb resistance region on pRSB101 is located within an integron-containing Tn402-like transposon. The variable region of the class 1 integron carries the genes dhfr1 for a dihydrofolate reductase, aadA2 for a spectinomycin/streptomycin adenylyltransferase and blaTLA-2 for a so far unknown Ambler class A extended spectrum β-lactamase. The integron-specific 3′-segment (qacEΔ1-sul1-orf5Δ) is connected to a macrolide resistance operon consisting of the genes mph(A) (macrolide 2′-phosphotransferase I), mrx (hydrophobic protein of unknown function) and mphR(A) (regulatory protein). Finally, a putative mobile element with the tetracycline resistance genes tetA (tetracycline efflux pump) and tetR was identified upstream of the Tn402-specific transposase gene tniA. The second 'genetic load' region on pRSB101 harbours four distinct mobile genetic elements, another integron belonging to a new class and footprints of two more transposable elements. A tripartite multidrug (MDR) transporter consisting of an ATP-binding-cassette (ABC)-type ATPase and permease, and an efflux membrane fusion protein (MFP) of the RND-family is encoded between the replication/partition and the mobilization module. Homologues of the macrolide resistance genes mph(A), mrx and mphR(A) were detected on eight other erythromycin resistance-plasmids isolated from activated sludge bacteria. Plasmid pRSB101-like repA amplicons were also obtained from plasmid-DNA preparations of the final effluents of the wastewater treatment plant indicating that pRSB101-like plasmids are released with the final effluents into the environment. © 2004 SGM.},

	abstract = {Microbial diversity of mine water at Zhong Tiaoshan copper mine, Shanxi province, China, was analyzed using a culture-independent 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) based on cloning approach. A total of 59 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were obtained from 226 clones from all three samples (8 OTUs from sample SX1, 25 from SX2 and 26 from SX3). 46 of them were representative OTUs and were sequenced. 93.5% of the total clones had sequences that were less than 5% difference from those in the nucleic acids database. The percentage of overlapping OTUs among samples was from 12.1% to 35.3%. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 60.62% of the clones were affiliated with members of the Proteobacteria (α-3.10%, β-24.78%, γ-31.41%, δ-1.33%), whereas 29.20% of the clones were closely related to the Nitrospira (Leptospirillum ferrooxidans 20.80%, Leptospirillum ferriphilum 0.88% and Leptospirillum group III 7.52%, respectively). The rest clones were affiliated with the Firmicutes (2.65%) and the Bacteroidetes (7.52%). The results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the percentages of OTUs and biogeochemical data revealed that biogeochemical properties affected the diversity of microbial communities in mine water. Especially, the pH value, temperature and different concentrations of elements such as lead, zinc, sulfur, iron and copper seemed to be key factors affecting the composition and structure of microbial communities in this study. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Microbial fuel cells (MFC) hold promise as a green technology for bioenergy production. The challenge is to improve the engineering design while exploiting the ability of microbes to generate and transfer electrons directly to electrodes. A strategy using a combination of improved anode design and an enrichment process was formulated to improve power densities. The design was based on a flow-through anode with minimal dead volume and a high electrode surface area per unit volume. The strategy focused on promoting biofilm formation via a combination of forced flow through the anode, carbon limitation, and step-wise reduction of external resistance. The enrichment process resulted in development of exoelectrogenic biofilm communities dominated by Anaeromusa spp. This is the first report identifying organisms from the Veillonellaceae family in MFCs. The power density of the resulting MFC using a ferricyanide cathode reached 300 W m-3 net anode volume (3220 mW m-2), which is about a third of what is estimated to be necessary for commercial consideration. The operational stability of the MFC using high specific surface area electrodes was demonstrated by operating the MFC for a period of over four months.},

Culture-independent methods are required to understand the genetic diversity, population structure and ecological roles of the majority of organisms. Metagenomics is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from their natural environment. Protocols have been developed to capture unexplored microbial diversity to overcome the existing barriers in estimation of diversity. New screening methods have been designed to select specific functional genes within metagenomic libraries to detect novel biocatalysts as well as bioactive molecules applicable to mankind. To study the complete gene or operon clusters, various vectors including cosmid, fosmid or bacterial artificial chromosomes are being developed. Bioinformatics tools and databases have added much to the study of microbial diversity.

As the water in the open space rises, the water might become contaminated with different pollutants and eventually start to flow in the open voids. This book addresses the processes related to mine abandonment from a hydrogeological perspective. After an introduction to the relevant hydrogeochemical processes the book gives detailed information about mine closure procedures. Based on in-situ measurements the hydrodynamic processes in a flooded mine are described and some of the mine closure flow models exemplified. As all investigations are based on precise data, the book gives some key issues of monitoring and sampling, especially flow monitoring. Then the book presents some new methodologies for conducting tracer tests in flooded mines and gives some hints to passive mine water treatment. At the end of the book thirteen well investigated case studies of flooded underground mine and mine water tracer tests are described and interpreted from a hydrodynamic point of view. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus caldus has been proposed to play a role in the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) produced in industrial biomining of sulfidic minerals. Here, we describe the regulation of a new cluster containing the gene encoding tetrathionate hydrolase (tetH), a key enzyme in the RISC metabolism of this bacterium. The cluster contains five cotranscribed genes, ISac1, rsrR, rsrS, tetH, and doxD, coding for a transposase, a two-component response regulator (RsrR and RsrS), tetrathionate hydrolase, and DoxD, respectively. As shown by quantitative PCR, rsrR, tetH, and doxD are upregulated to different degrees in the presence of tetrathionate. Western blot analysis also indicates upregulation of TetH in the presence of tetrathionate, thiosulfate, and pyrite. The tetH cluster is predicted to have two promoters, both of which are functional in Escherichia coli and one of which was mapped by primer extension. A pyrrolo-quinoline quinone binding domain in TetH was predicted by bioinformatic analysis, and the presence of an o-quinone moiety was experimentally verified, suggesting a mechanism for tetrathionate oxidation.

	abstract = {The cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding proline is an intrinsically slow process, although important in many biological processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In vivo, this isomerization is catalyzed by peptidyl-prolyl cis/transisomerases (PPIases). Here, we present the molecular and biochemical characterization of parvulin-type PPIase family members of the model legume Lotus japonicus, annotated as LjPar1, LjPar2, and LjPar3. Although LjPar1 and LjPar2 were found to be homologous to PIN1 (Protein Interacting with NIMA)-type parvulins and hPar14 from human, respectively, LjPar3 represents a novel multidomain parvulin, apparently present only in plants, that contains an active carboxyl-terminal sulfurtransferase domain. All Lotus parvulins were heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and purified protein verification measurements used a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomic method. The biochemical characterization of the recombinant Lotus parvulins revealed that they possess PPIase activity toward synthetic tetrapeptides, although they exhibited different substrate specificities depending on the amino acid amino terminal to proline. These differences were also studied in a structural context using molecular modeling of the encoded polypeptides. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the three parvulin genes of Lotus are ubiquitously expressed in all plant organs. LjPar1 was found to be up-regulated during the later stages of nodule development. Subcellular localization of LjPar-enhanced Yellow Fluorescence Protein (eYFP) fusions expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf epidermal cells revealed that LjPar1 and LjPar2-eYFP fusions were localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, in contrast to LjPar3-eYFP, which was clearly localized in plastids. Divergent substrate specificities, expression profiles, and subcellular localization indicate that plant parvulin-type PPIases are probably involved in a wide range of biochemical and physiological processes. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

	abstract = {Plasmid metagenome nucleotide sequence data were recently obtained from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) bacteria with reduced susceptibility to selected antimicrobial drugs by applying the ultrafast 454-sequencing technology. The sequence dataset comprising 36,071,493 bases (346,427 reads with an average read length of 104 bases) was analysed for genetic diversity and composition by using a newly developed bioinformatic pipeline based on assignment of environmental gene tags (EGTs) to protein families stored in the Pfam database. Short amino acid sequences deduced from the plasmid metagenome sequence reads were compared to profile hidden Markov models underlying Pfam. Obtained matches evidenced that many reads represent genes having predicted functions in plasmid replication, stability and plasmid mobility which indicates that WWTP bacteria harbour genetically stabilised and mobile plasmids. Moreover, the data confirm a high diversity of plasmids residing in WWTP bacteria. The mobile organic peroxide resistance plasmid pMAC from Acinetobacter baumannii was identified as reference plasmid for the most abundant replication module type in the sequenced sample. Accessory plasmid modules encode different transposons, insertion sequences, integrons, resistance and virulence determinants. Most of the matches to Transposase protein families were identified for transposases similar to the one of the chromate resistance transposon Tn5719. Noticeable are hits to β-lactamase protein families which suggests that plasmids from WWTP bacteria encode different enzymes possessing β-lactam-hydrolysing activity. Some of the sequence reads correspond to antibiotic resistance genes that were only recently identified in clinical isolates of human pathogens. EGT analysis thus proofed to be a very valuable method to explore genetic diversity and composition of the present plasmid metagenome dataset. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapidly developing proteomics technologies help to advance the global understanding of physiological and cellular processes. The lifestyle of a study organism determines the type and complexity of a given proteomic project. The complexity of this study is characterized by a broad collection of pathway-specific subproteomes, reflecting the metabolic versatility as well as the regulatory potential of the aromatic-degrading, denitrifying bacterium 'Aromatoleum' sp. strain EbN1. Differences in protein profiles were determined using a gel-based approach. Protein identification was based on a progressive application of MALDI-TOF-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS. This progression was result-driven and automated by software control. The identification rate was increased by the assembly of a project-specific list of background signals that was used for internal calibration of the MS spectra, and by the combination of two search engines using a dedicated MetaScoring algorithm. In total, intelligent bioinformatics could increase the identification yield from 53 to 70% of the analyzed 5,050 gel spots; a total of 556 different proteins were identified. MS identification was highly reproducible: most proteins were identified more than twice from parallel 2DE gels with an average sequence coverage of >50% and rather restrictive score thresholds (Mascot ≥95, ProFound ≥2.2, MetaScore ≥97). The MS technologies and bioinformatics tools that were implemented and integrated to handle this complex proteomic project are presented. In addition, we describe the basic principles and current developments of the applied technologies and provide an overview over the current state of microbial proteome research. Copyright © 2006 S.

	abstract = {Staphylococcus xylosus is a Gram-positive bacterium found on the skin of mammals and frequently isolated from food plants and fermented cheese or meat. To gain further insight in protein determinants involved in biofilm formation by this coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, a comparative proteomic analysis between planktonic and sessile cells was performed. With the use of a protocol previously developed, protein patterns of the cytoplasmic and cell envelope fractions were compared by 2-DE. Following protein identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses, this study revealed differences in expression levels of 89 distinct proteins with 55 up-expressed and 34 down-expressed proteins in biofilm compared to planktonic cells. Most proteins differentially expressed were related to nitrogen and carbon metabolisms. Besides amino acid biosynthesis and protein translation, protein determinants related to protein secretion were up-expressed in biofilm, suggesting a more active protein trafficking in sessile cells. While up-expression of several enzymes involved in pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways was observed in biofilm, connections with unexpected metabolic routes were further unravelled. Indeed, this proteomic analysis allowed identifying novel proteins that could be involved in a previously uncovered exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway in S. xylosus as well as several enzymes related to polyketide biosynthesis. This findings are particularly relevant considering exopolysaccharide production in S. xylosus is /ca-independent contrary to coagulase-negative model strain Staphylococcus ep/derm/d/s RP62A. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Normalization is a prerequisite for accurate real time PCR (qPCR) expression analysis and for the validation of microarray profiling data in microbial systems. The choice and use of reference genes that are stably expressed across samples, experimental conditions and designs is a key consideration for the accurate interpretation of gene expression data. Results: Here, we evaluate a carefully selected set of reference genes derived from previous microarray-based transcriptional profiling experiments performed on Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and identify a set of genes with minimal variability under five different experimental conditions that are frequently used in Acidithiobacilli research. Suitability of these and other previously reported reference genes to monitor the expression of four selected target genes from A. ferrooxidans grown with different energy sources was investigated. Utilization of reference genes map, rpoC, alaS and era results in improved interpretation of gene expression profiles in A. ferrooxidans. Conclusion: This investigation provides a validated set of reference genes for studying A. ferrooxidans gene expression under typical biological conditions and an initial point of departure for exploring new experimental setups in this microorganism and eventually in other closely related Acidithiobacilli. The information could also be of value for future transcriptomic experiments in other bacterial systems. © 2009 Nieto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The two families represent the cupredoxins and multicopper oxidases, both containing blue copper-binding domains. These families present a challenging case due to low sequence similarity, different local structure, and variable sequence conservation at their copper-binding active sites. In this study, we investigate a new approach for automatically identifying weak sequence similarities that is based on combinatorial pattern discovery. We compare its performance with a traditional, HMM-based scheme and obtain estimates for sensitivity and specificity of the two approaches.

	abstract = {Aims: To understand the composition and structure of microbial communities in different acid mineral bioleaching systems, and to present a more complete picture of microbially mediated acid mine drainage production. Methods and Results: In Tong Shankou Copper Mine, China, two samples (named K1 and K2) from two different sites with bioleaching were studied. A bacterial 16S rDNA library and an archaeal 16S rDNA library of the sample from each site were constructed by 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing. A total of 18 bacterial representative sequences and 12 archaeal representative sequences were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 77.09% of the total bacterial clones were affiliated with Proteobacteria, and 21.22% of the total bacterial clones were closely related to Nitrospira. The rest of the bacterial clones were related to Firmicutes (1.68%). Sequences affiliated with the archaea of the Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma lineages were detected abundantly in the two samples. Unexpectedly, sequences affiliated with Sulfolobales and Methanothermus genera were also detected. Conclusions: The molecular studies appear to be consistent with the environmental conditions existing at the sites, which coincides with previous studies. High concentrations of some elements (such as copper, iron and sulfur) seemed to be the key factors resulting in the diverse distribution of typical iron-oxidizing bacteria such as Leptospirillum species and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Significance and Impact of the Study: Research on micro-organisms present in bioleaching systems especially archaea is not abundant. The acidophiles in the two bioleaching sites obtained from Tong Shankou Copper Mine, China, have not been reported until now. These results may expand our knowledge of the microbial diversity in the acid mineral bioleaching systems. © 2007 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes serious nosocomial infections, and an important virulence factor produced by this organism is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This review summarizes knowledge about biosynthesis of all three structural domains of LPS - lipid A, core oligosaccharide, and O polysaccharides. In addition, based on similarities with other bacterial species, this review proposes new hypothetical pathways for unstudied steps in the biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa LPS. Lipid A biosynthesis is discussed in relation to Escherichia coli and Salmonella, and the biosyntheses of core sugar precursors and core oligosaccharide are summarised. Pseudomonas aeruginosa attaches a Common Polysaccharide Antigen and O-Specific Antigen polysaccharides to lipid A-core. Both forms of O polysaccharide are discussed with respect to their independent synthesis mechanisms. Recent advances in understanding O-polysaccharide biosynthesis since the last major review on this subject, published nearly a decade ago, are highlighted. Since P. aeruginosa O polysaccharides contain unusual sugars, sugar-nucleotide biosynthesis pathways are reviewed in detail. Knowledge derived from detailed studies in the O5, O6 and O11 serotypes is applied to predict biosynthesis pathways of sugars in poorly-studied serotypes, especially O1, O4, and O13/O14. Although further work is required, a full understanding of LPS biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa is almost within reach. © SAGE Publications 2009.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a chemolithoautotrophic acidophile capable of obtaining energy by oxidizing ferrous iron or sulfur compounds such as metal sulfides. Some of the proteins involved in these oxidations have been described as forming part of the periplasm of this extremophile. The detailed study of the periplasmic components constitutes an important area to understand the physiology and environmental interactions of microorganisms. Proteomics analysis of the periplasmic fraction of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 was performed by using high resolution linear ion trap-FT MS. We identified a total of 131 proteins in the periplasm of the microorganism grown in thiosulfate. When possible, functional categories were assigned to the proteins: 13.8% were transport and binding proteins, 14.6% were several kinds of cell envelope proteins, 10.8% were involved in energy metabolism, 10% were related to protein fate and folding, 10% were proteins with unknown functions, and 26.1 % were proteins without homologues in databases. These last proteins are most likely characteristic of A. ferrooxidans and may have important roles yet to be assigned. The majority of the periplasmic proteins from A. ferrooxidans were very basic compared with those of neutrophilic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, suggesting a special adaptation of the chemolithoautotrophic bacterium to its very acidic environment. The high throughput proteomics approach used here not only helps to understand the physiology of this extreme acidophile but also offers an important contribution to the functional annotation for the available genomes of blomining microorganisms such as A. ferrooxidans for which no efficient genetic systems are available to disrupt genes by procedures such as homologous recombination. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	abstract = {Legionella pneumophila is an opportunistic pathogen that in the environment colonizes biofilms and replicates within amoebae. The bacteria employ the intracellular multiplication/defective organelle trafficking (Icm/Dot) type IV secretion system to grow intracellularly in a specific vacuole. Using Acanthamoeba castellanii as a host cell, we have previously identified IcsC (Legionella cytotoxic suppressor), a paralogue of the lipid A disaccharide synthase lpxB, as a cytotoxic factor of L. pneumophila. A bioinformatic analysis of the genome revealed that L. pneumophila is unique in harbouring two paralogues of lpxB and two and three paralogues of the lipid A biosynthesis acyltransferases lpxA and lpxD, respectively. LcsC (lpxB1) forms a transcriptional unit with gnnA, encoding a putative UDP-GlcNAc oxidase in the biosynthetic pathway leading to 3- aminoglucosamine analogues of lipid A. LpxB2 clusters with lpxD2, lpxA2 and IpxL paralogues, encoding secondary acyltransferases. LcsC/lpxB1 and lpxB2 were found to partially complement the growth defect of an Escherichia coli lpxB conditional mutant strain, indicating that both corresponding enzymes possess lipid A disaccharide synthase activity. The two L. pneumophila lpxB paralogues are not functionally equivalent, since expression of IcsC/lpxB1 but not lpxB2 in an L. pneumophila icmG mutant is cytotoxic for A. castellanii, and LPS purified from the two strains triggers CD14-dependent tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α production by macrophages with a different potency. The lpxB and lpxA paralogues are expressed under various growth conditions, including broth, biofilms and in A. castellanii. While the flagellar gene flaA is mainly expressed in late stationary phase, the lpxB and lpxA paralogues are preferentially expressed in the exponential and early stationary phases. Upon exposure to hypotonic stress and nutrient deprivation, lpxA1, and to a lesser extent IcsC/lpxB1, is upregulated. The differential regulation of lpxB or lpxA paralogues in response to changing environmental conditions might allow L. pneumophila to adapt its lipid A structure. © 2007 SGM.},

	abstract = {During the past few decades the microbial bioleaching of metallic sulphide ores has become a very important process utilized by the mining industry. The biodiversity studies of industrial systems have revealed the occurrence of acidophilic microorganisms, forming dynamic communities that include bacteria and archaea. A combination of molecular and cultivation-based approaches has been used during the leaching cycle to understand the key microorganisms present and their function in the Escondida Sulphide Leach Plant. The global genomic expression in solution samples has been analyzed by random arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR), to pinpoint those microorganisms with active metabolism in the communities present in regions of the heap leach operation of different ages. Four random primers were used and one hundred and twenty RAP-PCR products were cloned, sequenced and compared to databases using the BLAST search algorithm. Approximately 48% of the RAP-PCR products were 16S and 23S rRNA genes, and many of these results are consistent with community analysis carried out on the same heap using 16S rRNA gene libraries and real-time PCR. Interestingly, different microorganisms to those previously detected by 16S rRNA PCR-DGGE, represented by sequences distantly related to the archaea Picrophilus torridus, and Thermoplasma acidophilum sequences, were detected using RNA analysis. Eight different RAP-PCR products shared similarity with functional genes, and sequence analysis revealed the expression of genes associated with transcription (RNA polymerase) and translation (elongation factor and ribosomal protein) components, metabolic function (2-methylisocitrate synthase and pyruvate dehydrogenase), and electron transport (cytochrome). Other genes such as mercuric reductase and ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins were also detected. However, 30% of RAP-PCR products showed no similarity with any sequences currently in the database. This report represents the first transcriptomic study of the microbial community inhabiting an industrial bioleaching system. The data suggest that the functional spectrum of expressed genes was consistent with genomic and proteomic reports from pure cultures and environmental AMD samples containing microorganisms involved in bioleaching processes. Both studies revealed the expression of genes mainly related to energetic metabolisms and stress responses. © 2008.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have provided unprecedented access into the diversity of the microbial world. Herein we use the comparative genomic analysis of microbial genomes and environmental metagenomes coupled with structural modelling to explore the diversity of aerobic respiration in Archaea. We focus on the heme-copper oxidoreductase superfamily which is responsible for catalyzing the terminal reaction in aerobic respiration - the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Sequence analyses demonstrate that there are at least eight heme-copper oxygen reductase families: A-, B-, C-, D-, E-, F-, G-, and H-families. Interestingly, five of these oxygen reductase families (D-, E-, F-, G-, and H-families) are currently found exclusively in Archaea. We review the structural properties of all eight families focusing on the members found within Archaea. Structural modelling coupled with sequence analysis suggests that many of the oxygen reductases identified from thermophilic Archaea have modified proton channel properties compared to the currently studied mesophilic bacterial oxygen reductases. These structural differences may be due to adaptation to the specific environments in which these enzymes function. We conclude with a brief analysis of the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of Archaeal heme-copper oxygen reductases. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The similarities and differences in the structures of the nifH gene pools of six different soils (Montrond, LCSA-p, Vernon, Dombes, LCSA-c, and Thysse Kaymor) and five soil fractions extracted from LCSA-c were studied. Bacterial DNA was directly extracted from the soils, and a region of the nifH gene was amplified by PCR and analyzed by restriction. Soils were selected on the basis of differences in soil management, plant cover, and major physicochemical properties. Microenvironments differed on the basis of the sizes of the constituent particles and the organic carbon and clay contents. Restriction profiles were subjected to principal-component analysis. We showed that the composition of the diazotrophic communities varied both on a large scale (among soils) and on a microscale (among microenvironments in LCSA-c soil). Soil management seemed to be the major parameter influencing differences in the nifH gene pool structure among soils by controlling inorganic nitrogen content and its variation. However, physicochemical parameters (texture and total C and N contents) were found to correlate with differences among nifH gene pools on a microscale. We hypothesize that the observed nifH genetic structures resulted from the adaptation to fluctuating conditions (cultivated soil, forest soil, coarse fractions) or constant conditions (permanent pasture soil, fine fractions). We attempted to identify a specific band within the profile of the clay fraction by cloning and sequencing it and comparing it with the gene databases. Unexpectedly, the nifH sequences of the dominant bacteria were most similar to sequences of unidentified marine eubacteria.},

	abstract = {The evolution of microbial populations involved in simulated-heap leaching of a polymetallic black schist sulfide ore (from the recently-commissioned Talvivaara mine, Finland) was monitored in aerated packed bed column reactors over a period of 40 weeks. The influence of ore particle size (2-6.5 mm and 6.5-12 mm) on changes in composition of the bioleaching microflora and mineral leaching dynamics in columns was investigated and compared to fine-grain (<2 μm) ore that was bioprocessed in shake flask cultures. Both column reactors and shake flasks were inoculated with 24 different species and strains of mineral-oxidizing and other acidophilic micro-organisms, and maintained at 37°C. Mineral oxidation was most rapid in shake flask cultures, with about 80% of both manganese and nickel and 68% of zinc being leached within 6 weeks, though relatively little of the copper present in the ore was solubilised. The microbial consortium that emerged from the original inoculum was relatively simple in shake flasks, and was dominated by the iron-oxidizing autotroph Leptospirillum ferriphilum, with smaller numbers of Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus caldus and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans. Both metal recovery and (for the most part) total numbers of prokaryotes were greater in the column reactor containing the medium-grain than that containing the coarse-grain ore. The bioleaching communities in the columns displayed temporal changes in composition and differed radically from those in shake flask cultures. While iron-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria were always the most numerically dominant bacteria in the medium-grain column bioreactor, there were major shifts in the most abundant species present, with the type strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans dominating in the early phase of the experiment and other bacteria (At. ferrooxidans NO37 and L. ferriphilum) dominating from week 4 to week 40. With the coarse-grain column bioreactor, similar transitions in populations of iron-oxidizing chemoautotrophs were observed, though heterotrophic acidophiles were often the most abundant bacteria found in mineral leach liquors. Four bacteria not included in the mixed culture used to inoculate the columns were detected by biomolecular techniques and three of these (all Alicyclobacillus- like Firmicutes) were isolated as pure cultures. The fourth bacterium, identified from a clone library, was related to the Gram-positive sulfate reducer Desulfotomaculum salinum. All four were considered to have been present as endospores on the dried ore, which was not sterilized in the column bioreactors. Two of the Alicyclobacillus-like isolates were found, transiently, in large numbers in mineral leachates. The data support the hypothesis that temporal and spatial heterogeneity in mineral heaps create conditions that favour different mineral-oxidizing microflora, and that it is therefore important that sufficient microbial diversity is present in heaps to optimize metal extraction. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Theoretical Microscopic Titration Curves (THEMATICS) may be used to identify chemically important residues in active sites of enzymes by characteristic deviations from the normal, sigmoidal Henderson-Hasselbalch titration behavior. Clusters of such deviant residues in physical proximity constitute reliable predictors of the location of the active site. Originally the residues with deviant predicted behavior were identified by human observation of the computed titration curves. However, it is preferable to select the unusual residues by mathematically well-defined criteria, in order to reduce the chance of error, eliminate any possible biases, and substantially speed up the selection process. Here we present some simple statistical tests that constitute such selection criteria. The first derivatives of the predicted titration curves resemble distribution functions and are normalized. The moments of these first derivative functions are computed. It is shown that the third and fourth moments, measures of asymmetry and kurtosis, respectively, are good measures of the deviations from normal behavior. Results are presented for 44 different enzymes. Detailed results are given for 4 enzymes with 4 different types of chemistry: arginine kinase from Limulus polyphemus (horseshoe crab); β-lactamase from Escherichia coli; glutamate racemase from Aquifex pyrophilus; and 3-isopropyl-malate dehydrogenase from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The relationship between the statistical measures of nonsigmoidal behavior in the predicted titration curves and the catalytic activity of the residue is discussed. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Analysis of arsenic concentrations in New Jersey well water from the Newark Basin showed up to 15% of the wells exceed 10 μg L-1, with a maximum of 215 μg L-1. In some geologic settings in the basin, this mobile arsenic could be from the weathering of pyrite (FeS2) found in black shale that contains up to 4% arsenic by weight. We hypothesized that under oxic conditions at circumneutral pH, the microbially mediated oxidation of sulfide in the pyrite lattice would lead to the release of pyrite-bound arsenic. Moreover, the oxidation of aqueous As(III) to As(V) by aerobic microorganisms could further enhance arsenic mobilization from the solid phase. Enrichment cultures under aerobic, As(III)-oxidizing conditions were established under circumneutral pH with weathered black shale from the Newark Basin as the inoculum source. Strain WAO, an autotrophic inorganic-sulfur and As(III)-oxidizer, was isolated and phylogenetically and physiologically characterized. Arsenic mobilization studies from arsenopyrite (FeAsS) mineral, conducted with strain WAO at circumneutral pH, showed microbially enhanced mobilization of arsenic and complete oxidation of released arsenic and sulfur to stoichiometric amounts of arsenate and sulfate. In addition, WAO preferentially colonized pyrite on the surface of arsenic-bearing, black shale thick sections. These findings support the hypothesis that microorganisms can directly mobilize and transform arsenic bound in mineral form at circumneutral pH and suggest that the microbial mobilization of arsenic into groundwater may be important in other arsenic-impacted aquifers. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is one of the main acidophilic chemolithotrophic bacteria involved in the bioleaching of metal sulfide ores. The bacterium-mineral interaction requires the development of biofilms, whose formation is regulated in many microorganisms by type AI-1 quorum sensing. Here, we report the existence and characterization of a functional type AI-1 quorum-sensing system in A. ferrooxidans. This microorganism produced mainly acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) with medium and large acyl chains and different C-3 substitutions, including 3-hydroxy-C8-AHL, 3-hydroxy-C 10-AHL, C12-AHL, 3-OXO-C12-AHL, 3-hydroxy-C12-AHL, C14-AHL, 3-OXO-C14-AHL, 3-hydroxy-C14-AHL, and 3-hydroxy-C16-AHL. A quorum-sensing genetic locus that includes two open reading frames, afeI and afeR, which have opposite orientations and code for proteins with high levels of similarity to members of the acyl synthase (I) and transcriptional regulator (R) protein families, respectively, was identified. Overexpression of AfeI in Escherichia coli and the associated synthesis of AHLs confirmed that AfeI is an AHL synthase. As determined by reverse transcription-PCR, the afeI and afeR genes were transcribed in A. ferrooxidans. The transcription levels of the afeI gene were higher in cells grown in sulfur and thiosulfate media than in iron-grown cells. Phosphate starvation induced an increase in the transcription levels of afeI which correlated with an increase in AHL levels. Two afe boxes which could correspond to the AfeR binding sites were identified upstream of the afeI gene. This is the first report of a functional type AI-1 quorum-sensing system in an acidophilic chemolithotrophic microorganism, and our results provide a very interesting opportunity to explore the control and regulation of biofilm formation during the bioleaching process.

	abstract = {The microbial populations of biomining communities are complex and diverse, including bacteria, archaea and fungi. Low pH, abundance of mineral particles, presence of microorganisms in biofilms and the species diversity of microorganisms inhabiting the biomining environment has made studying these populations difficult. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) is increasingly used for the enumeration of microorganisms in the environment and has been used to study the populations in various biomining systems. This study evaluates the use of Q-PCR for the enumeration of biomining microorganisms in liquid cultures. Spectrophotometric quantification of extracted DNA was compared with a SYBR Green Q-PCR assay. The 16S rRNA gene was targeted for Q-PCR quantification of three biomining bacteria: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans and the archaeon Ferroplasma acidiphilum. Primers were designed to amplify a 390 ± 35 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene. Southern blot hybridisation was used to determine the number of 16S rRNA gene copies per genome. Standard curves were constructed with DNA from Sinorhizobium meliloti and At. ferrooxidans. Using a standard curve constructed with At. ferrooxidans DNA there was no statistical difference between quantification using Q-PCR and the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (P < 0.05). However, there was a statistical difference when quantifying the archaeon (P > 0.05). © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Microbial redox reactions involving inorganic sulfur compounds, mainly the sulfur anions, are one of the vital reactions responsible for the environmental sulfur balance. These reactions are mediated by phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes, some of which also take part in the extraction of metal ions from their sulfur containing ores. These sulfur oxidizers oxidize inorganic sulfur compounds like sulfide, thiosulfate etc. to produce reductants that are used for carbon dioxide fixation or in respiratory electron transfer chains. The sulfur oxidizing gene cluster (sox) of α-Proteobacteria comprises of at least 15 genes, forming two transcriptional units, viz., soxSR and soxVWXYZABCDEFGH. SoxV is known to be a CcdA homolog involved in the transport of reductants from cytoplasm to periplasm. SoxW and SoxS are periplasmic thioredoxins, which (SoxW) interact with SoxV and thereby help in the redox reactions. We have employed homology modeling to construct the three-dimensional structures of the SoxV, SoxW and SoxS proteins from Rhodovulum sulfidophilum. With the help of docking and molecular dynamics simulations we have identified the amino acid residues of these proteins involved in the interaction. The probable biochemical mechanism of the transport of reductants through the interactions of these proteins has also been investigated. Our study provides a rational basis to interpret the molecular mechanism of the biochemistry of sulfur anion oxidation reactions by these ecologically important organisms. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {An understanding of the physiology and metabolic complexity of microbial consortia involved in metal solubilization is a prerequisite for the rational improvement of bioleaching technologies. Among the most challenging aspects that remain to be addressed is how aerobic acidophiles, especially Fe(II)-oxidizers, contend with the paradoxical hazards of iron overload and iron deficiency, each with deleterious consequences for growth. Homeostatic mechanisms regulating the acquisition, utilization/oxidation, storage and intracellular mobilization of cellular iron are deemed to be critical for fitness and survival of bioleaching microbes. In an attempt to contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the biology and ecology of the microbial communities in bioleaching econiches, we have used comparative genomics and other bioinformatic tools to reconstruct the iron management strategies in newly sequenced acidithiobacilli and other biomining genomes available in public databases. Species-specific genes have been identified with distinctive functional roles in iron management as well as genes shared by several species in biomining consortia. Their analysis contributes to our understanding of the general survival strategies in acidic and iron loaded environments and suggests functions for genes with currently unknown functions that might reveal novel aspects of iron response in acidophiles. Comprehensive examination of the occurrence and conservation of regulatory functions and regulatory sites also allowed the prediction of the metal regulatory networks for these biomining microbes. © 2007 Trans Tech Publications.},

	abstract = {Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a Gram-negative, chemolithoautotrophic bacterium involved in metal bioleaching. Using the RNA arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR), we have identified several cDNAs that were differentially expressed when A. ferrooxidans LR was submitted to potassium- and phosphate-limiting conditions. One of these cDNAs showed similarity with ribB. An analysis of the A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 genome, made available by The Institute for Genomic Research, showed that the ribB gene was not located in the rib operon, but a ribBA gene was present in this operon instead. The ribBA gene was isolated from A. ferrooxidans LR and expression of both ribB and ribBA was investigated. Transcript levels of both genes were enhanced in cells grown in the absence of K2HPO4, in the presence of zinc and copper sulfate and in different pHs. Transcript levels decreased upon exposure to a temperature higher than the ideal 30 °C and at pH 1.2. A comparative genomic analysis using the A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 genome revealed similar putative regulatory elements for both genes. Moreover, an RFN element was identified upstream from the ribB gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of RibB and RibBA in bacteria showed six different combinations. We suggest that the presence of duplicated riboflavin synthesis genes in bacteria must provide their host with some benefit in certain stressful situations. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We investigated the diversity and population structure of snottites from three locations in the cave system using full cycle rRNA methods and culturing. The snottites were composed primarily of bacteria related to Acidithiobacillus species. Other populations present in the snottites included Thermoplasmata group archaea, bacteria related to Sulfobacillus, Acidimicrobium, and the proposed bacterial lineage TM6, protists, and filamentous fungi. Based on fluorescence in situ hybridization population counts, Acidithiobacillus are key members of the snottite communities, accompanied in some cases by smaller numbers of archaea related to Ferroplasma and other Thermoplasmata. Diversity estimates show that the Frasassi snottites are among the lowest-diversity natural microbial communities known, with one to six prokaryotic phylotypes observed depending on the sample.

Hydrgeneses are a structurally and functionally diverse group of enzymes and efforts have been made to augment them. This showed the presence of such enzymes in a variety of organisms including pathogens and of multiple hydrogenases. The roles of such enzymes and their biosynthesis and activity can be derived from its postgenomic analysis. Hydrogenases' main role is the oxidation of H2 or the reduction of protons, coupled to energy-conserving electron-transfer chain reactions. This permits energy to be obtained from H2 or from the oxidation of substrates of lower potential. They are restricted to the prokaryotes but nevertheless widely distributed. The biological production of H2 has been stimulated by interests in finding alternatives in fossil fuels. Structural studies of hydrogenases will be relevant in directing protein engineering. Also of relevance is the investigation of H2 metabolism and regulation for engineering microorganisms at the cellular level to maximize H2 production. Many of the so-far uncultivated species will then contain hydrogenases.},

	abstract = {The free energy of heme reduction in different proteins is found to vary over more than 18 kcal/mol. It is a challenge to determine how proteins manage to achieve this enormous range of E ms with a single type of redox cofactor. Proteins containing 141 unique hemes of a-, b-, and c-type, with bis-His, His-Met, and aquo-His ligation were calculated using Multi-Conformation Continuum Electrostatics (MCCE). The experimental E ms range over 800 mV from -350 mV in cytochrome c 3 to 450 mV in cytochrome c peroxidase (vs. SHE). The quantitative analysis of the factors that modulate heme electrochemistry includes the interactions of the heme with its ligands, the solvent, the protein backbone, and sidechains. MCCE calculated E ms are in good agreement with measured values. Using no free parameters the slope of the line comparing calculated and experimental E ms is 0.73 (R 2 = 0.90), showing the method accounts for 73% of the observed E m range. Adding a +160 mV correction to the His-Met c-type hemes yields a slope of 0.97 (R 2 5 0.93). With the correction 65% of the hemes have an absolute error smaller than 60 mV and 92% are within 120 mV. The overview of heme proteins with known structures and E ms shows both the lowest and highest potential hemes are c-type, whereas the b-type hemes are found in the middle E m range. In solution, bis-His ligation lowers the E m by ≈205 mV relative to hemes with His-Met ligands. The bis-His, aquo-His, and His-Met ligated b-type hemes all cluster about E ms which are ≈200 mV more positive in protein than in water. In contrast, the low potential bis-His c-type hemes are shifted little from in solution, whereas the high potential His-Met c-type hemes are raised by ≈300 mV from solution. The analysis shows that no single type of interaction can be identified as the most important in setting heme electrochemistry in proteins. For example, the loss of solvation (reaction field) energy, which raises the E m, has been suggested to be a major factor in tuning in situ E ms. However, the calculated solvation energy vs. experimental E m shows a slope of 0.2 and R 2 of 0.5 thus correlates weakly with E ms. All other individual interactions show even less correlation with E m. However the sum of these terms does reproduce the range of observed E ms. Therefore, different proteins use different aspects of their structures to modulate the in situ heme electrochemistry. This study also shows that the calculated E ms are relatively insensitive to different heme partial charges and to the protein dielectric constant used in the simulation. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This has allowed the prediction of metabolic and regulatory models for each species and has provided a unique opportunity to undertake comparative genomic studies of this group of related bioleaching bacteria. In this paper, the presence or absence of predicted genes for eleven metabolic processes, electron transfer pathways and other phenotypic characteristics are reported for the three acidithiobacilli: CO2 fixation, the TCA cycle, sulfur oxidation, sulfur reduction, iron oxidation, iron assimilation, quorum sensing via the acyl homoserine lactone mechanism, hydrogen oxidation, flagella formation, Che signaling (chemotaxis) and nitrogen fixation. Predicted transcriptional and metabolic interplay between pathways pinpoints possible coordinated responses to environmental signals such as energy source, oxygen and nutrient limitations. The predicted pathway for nitrogen fixation in A. ferrooxidans will be described as an example of such an integrated response. Several responses appear to be especially characteristic of autotrophic microorganisms and may have direct implications for metabolic processes of critical relevance to the understanding of how these microorganisms survive and proliferate in extreme environments, including industrial bioleaching operations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The transport of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for the growth of all organisms. The metabolism of soil-dwelling Streptomyces species, and their ability to produce antibiotics and other secondary metabolites, are strongly influenced by the availability of phosphate. The transcriptional regulation of the SCO4138 and SCO1845 genes of Streptomyces coelicolor was studied. These genes encode the two pytative low-affinity Pi transporters PitH1 and PitH2, respectively. Expression of these genes and that of the high-affinity transport system pstSCAB follows a sequential pattern in response to phosphate deprivation, as shown by coupling their promoters to a luciferase reporter gene. Expression of pitH2, but not that of pap-pitH1 (a bicistronic transcript), is dependent upon the response regulator PhoP. PhoP binds to specific sequences consisting of direct repeats of 11 nt in the promoter of pitH2, but does not bind to the pap-pitH1 promoter, which lacks these direct repeats for PhoP recognition. The transcription start point of the pitH2 promoter was identified by primer extension analyses, and the structure of the regulatory sequences in the PhoP-protected DNA region was established. It consists of four central direct repeats flanked by two other less conserved repeats. A model for PhoP regulation of this promoter is proposed based on the four promoter DNA-PhoP complexes detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and footprinting studies. © 2008 SGM.},

Electron microscopy studies showed that the morphology of the strain DBM was rod-shaped. Strain DBM reduced 10 mM of sulfate completely to sulfide within 7 d, and it recovered its sulfate reduction ability after 7 d of aerobic growth. Furthermore, strain DBM effectively precipitated 0.40 mM copper during its growth. Elemental composition of the resulting microbial precipitate was studied using electro-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and it was found that the ratio of S:Cu was 1.07. The result was consistent with the formation of copper sulfide.

	abstract = {A 1.3-kb insertion sequence, termed ISAfe1 (U66426), from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 is described. ISAfe1 exhibits the features of a typical bacterial insertion sequence. It has 26-bp, imperfectly matched, terminal inverted repeats and an open reading frame (ORF) that potentially encodes a transposase (TPase) of 404 amino acids (AAB07489) with significant similarity to members of the ISL3 family of insertion sequences. A potential ribosome-binding site and potential -10 and -35 promoter sites for the TPase ORF were identified, and a +1 transcriptional start site was detected experimentally. A potential outwardly directed -35 site was identified in the right inverted repeat of ISAfe1. A second ORF (ORF B), of unknown function, was found on the complementary strand with significant similarity to ORF 2 of ISAe1 from Ralstonia eutropha. Southern blot analyses demonstrated that ISAfe1-like elements can be found in multiple copies in a variety of A. ferrooxidans strains and that they exhibit transposition. A codon adaptation index (CAI) analysis of the TPase of ISAfe1 indicates that is has a CAI of 0.726 and can be considered well adapted to its host, suggesting that ISAfe1 might be an ancient resident of A. ferrooxidans. Analysis of six of its target sites of insertion in the genome of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 indicates a preference for 8-bp pseudopalindromic sequences, one of which resembles the termini of its inverted repeats. Evidence is presented here that is consistent with the possibility that ISAfe1 can promote both plasmid cointegrate formation and resolution in E. coli.},

	abstract = {Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a gamma-proteobacterium that lives at pH2 and obtains energy by the oxidation of sulfur and iron. It is used in the biomining industry for the recovery of metals and is one of the causative agents of acid mine drainage. Effective tools for the study of its genetics and physiology are not in widespread use and, despite considerable effort, an understanding of its unusual physiology remains at a rudimentary level. Nearly complete genome sequences of A. ferrooxidans are available from two public sources and we have exploited this information to reconstruct aspects of its sulfur metabolism. Results: Two candidate mechanisms for sulfate uptake from the environment were detected but both belong to large paralogous families of membrane transporters and their identification remains tentative. Prospective genes, pathways and regulatory mechanisms were identified that are likely to be involved in the assimilation of sulfate into cysteine and in the formation of Fe-S centers. Genes and regulatory networks were also uncovered that may link sulfur assimilation with nitrogen fixation, hydrogen utilization and sulfur reduction. Potential pathways were identified for sulfation of extracellular metabolites that may possibly be involved in cellular attachment to pyrite, sulfur and other solid substrates. Conclusions: A bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence of A. ferrooxidans has revealed candidate genes, metabolic process and control mechanisms potentially involved in aspects of sulfur metabolism. Metabolic modeling provides an important preliminary step in understanding the unusual physiology of this extremophile especially given the severe difficulties involved in its genetic manipulation and biochemical analysis. © 2003 Valdés et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms were enumerated and isolated on selective solid media from a pilot-scale stirred-tank bioleaching operation in which a polymetallic sulfide concentrate was subjected to biologically accelerated oxidation at 45°C. Four distinct prokaryotes were isolated: three bacteria (an Acidithiobacillus caldus-like organism, a thermophilic Leptospirillum sp., and a Sulfobacillus sp.) and one archaeon (a Ferroplasma-like isolate). The relative numbers of these prokaryotes changed in the three reactors sampled, and the Ferroplasma isolate became increasingly dominant as mineral oxidation progressed, eventually accounting for >99% of plate isolates in the third of three in-line reactors. The identities of the isolates were confirmed by analyses of their 16S rRNA genes, and some key physiological traits (e.g., oxidation of iron and/or sulfur and autotrophy or heterotrophy) were examined. More detailed studies were carried out with the Leptospirillum and Ferroplasma isolates. The data presented here represent the first quantitative study of the microorganisms in a metal leaching situation and confirm that mixed cultures of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotic acidophiles catalyze the accelerated dissolution of sulfidic minerals in industrial tank bioleaching operations. The results show that indigenous acidophilic microbial populations change as mineral dissolution becomes more extensive.},
